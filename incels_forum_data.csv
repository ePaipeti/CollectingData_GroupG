Why are the rules so unusual?
This is a forum for men who can't get a partner and feel sad about it. Seeing romantically successful people brag about their experiences on the forum would be insulting, and would only exacerbate the issue.

Is there a Dark theme?
Yes. Press the theme button on the bottom left of the page.

Can I change my username?
Not directly. The community voted and decided against it.

I can't send private messages or vote in polls!
You're new. Be active on the site, and you'll be given permission automatically in time.

How do I add an image to my signature?
Upload the image to imgur.com. Click on the down arrow once it's uploaded -> Get share links and use the BBCode (forums) link.

How do ranks and stars work?
You earn one star per 100 posts, up to 5 stars. Once you get 500 posts your rank and color change, and you reset to one star again.

For each rank you need to have been registered one extra week on the site, this is so spamming to skip ranks isn't possible.
You can see all ranks in the Members section's sidebar. If you have the post count + registered time required for a rank, be patient; the 'upgrade' process runs every hour.

Can I erase my account?
Yes. Select the ""Disable Account"" option from your user dropdown or from your preferences.

Yes, but only three (3) months after the deletion of your old one. Just register again and link to your old account, so we can whitelist you. Don't pretend to be a new account because we'll confuse you for someone trying to avoid a ban. If you got banned and only then deleted the account, you don't qualify for this. You need to wait one (1) year instead. If you try to make an account before that, you will get banned and the 1-year timer will be reset. And yes, if you delete your account and then wait three months, you can get a new username by making a new account. Three months is a long time though, think about it carefully.

How can I stay safe online?
The same way you do anywhere else: Don't post personal information (name, address, phone, email, pictures, etc), unless you are comfortable exposing that information to the whole internet. If you want to go a step further, you can post with a proxy or a VPN.

How do warnings work?
Warnings are active for exactly 1 month by default. Active warnings will add up, and if they total 60% or more you will get a temporary ban (up to 4 days). At 100%, you'll be permanently banned.

Why was X user banned?
We do not announce reasons for warnings or bans, but you can try asking the user yourself. Otherwise, use the ban megathread in Offtopic.

What is low effort?
It is content that is unrelated to a thread, posted for memetic value, or spam-like in nature. Examples: an emote reply, quoting someone and adding nothing else, one-word replies, and many other variations. The content might as well not have been posted."
Introduction to Incels,Untagged,Incels,"Jan 18, 2018",75000,0,"Introduction to Incels

What does incel mean?
Incel means involuntary celibate, a person who wants to be in a loving relationship but is unable to find a partner despite his best effort. Incels want to be loved and give love back. Being ""incel"" is a state of being, not an identity. It is not a movement, ideology, or behavior, and there is nothing political about it.

Am I an incel?
If you find yourself wanting to be in a loving relationship but unable to find a partner despite a long duration of trying, you are.

What do Incels believe?
One does not need to share any particular belief at all to be incel. Incels can be liberal or conservative. They can be feminists or MRAs. Many who seek to attack incels wish to smear all incels by trying to associate us with fringe ideologies. Just like Muslims, who suffered similar broad slurs in the early 21th century, we would ask that you consider us as individual people, because that is what we are, each with our own life history and perspective.

What is the Bluepill?
The Bluepill is comprised of the rosy lies unattractive men are told as children to make them feel better. Men are told, ""Looks don't matter for men. Women want a confident guy who works hard and shows respect. If you can do that, the women will come to you!"" Many of us wish the Bluepill was true. Unfortunately, the Bluepill is not currently born out by science or reality.

What is the Redpill?
The Redpill proposes that if you know the actual factors that lead to male sexual/dating success, through targeted self improvement (like weight lifting) and psychological manipulation (PUA routines) a man can maximize his success. It focuses primarily only on factors a man can change about himself.

What is the Blackpill?
The Blackpill is a comprehensive, science-based perspective on what matters most in male-female sexual/relationship dynamics. It attempts to describe the objective truth about what men and women truly value most, even when it is not polite to discuss publicly.

Are incels virgins?
Most incels are virgins, but not necessarily all. For example, a man could date one girl and lose his virginity, but then fail to find a second partner later despite many years of trying. In that condition, he would have become incel. Another example would be a man who has slept with a prostitute. While he would not be a virgin anymore, he still would have never experienced a truly consensual romantic relationship, and could still thus be deemed incel.

Can girls be incel?
It's debated, and the answer leans towards no in most situations. Many experiments have shown that even artificially generated women created to be as repulsive looking as possible can get dates from men in online dating. So it is difficult to conceive a reasonable circumstance where a woman would truly be incel, unless it is just due to her high standards. Ultimately, however, every person decides if they are incel.

But unattractive men can get girlfriends!
The Blackpill looks at a man's likelihood for romantic success along every dimension: race, height, age, face, build, money, mental health, disabilities, and more. Certain ""unattractive"" features can be more harmful than others or compensated for in different ways. The Blackpill can help an unattractive man find his best pathway to success, if any exists. However, if a man has fallen short in every category of life, it is unlikely he will find a way to succeed. One must always look at the total picture.

What is this forum for?
Inceldom, the state of wanting a relationship without being able to find one, is linked to numerous mental health conditions such as depression and suicidal tendencies. Many incels feel isolated and have no one they can talk honestly to. This forum provides a safe place for incels to talk to others who are going through the same challenges. It lets people vent their frustrations, make friends, joke around, try to understand life, get support, figure out how to best cope with their problems, and maybe even find ways to solve them.

Why is the language on the forum so offensive?
We currently have a paradox in a society where ""racism"" or ""sexism"" is not okay in what we write, but perfectly acceptable in dating or even job hiring, where race and gender can determine whether someone gets a date or even a job. This is hypocrisy. If incels must be subjected to racism and sexism in their daily lives, many figure they may as well embrace that in their online vernacular as well. For example, incels use terms like ""currycels"" and ""ricecels"" to playful draw attention to the very real challenges these minorities face. This is part of our group sense of humor and is welcomed by regular posters who are very diverse.

Do incels hate women?
Incels again are not a homogeneous group. Most incels express that the thing they would love most would be a loving, caring, stable relationship with a woman who loves them back. Many speak fondly about what this would mean to them. Some are frustrated and angry they cannot achieve this, and they voice this verbally. Some blame women for their own ""sub-humanity"". Others blame the genetic lottery for making them that way. There is no one perspective unifying incels in terms of how women are viewed.

Are incels ""mass murderers""?
No mass murderers have been associated with our site and the site does not condone actions of those who have committed such crimes. The forum strives to maintain a peaceful place for incels to speak as freely as US Free Speech Laws allow. We do not regulate what users should or shouldn't feel (i.e., thought crime), as long as their comments remain within the limits of the law.

Thousands of men across the world who are not incels go on murderous rampages every day. Most of the biggest serial killers and mass murderers in history have been sexually successful men (e.g., Ted Bundy or Jeffrey Dahmer). There is therefore no convincing evidence that incel men pose any greater threat to the public than any other group of men. In fact, incel men are probably more likely to hurt themselves than anyone else, as suicide is a very common topic among incels.

Perhaps if the media and public took a greater interest in the reasons men are becoming incel or ways to help men, rather than trying to demonize and attack these lonely and sad people, some productive good could actually be done.

Is inceldom is a real, valid concern?
Yes. Male celibacy is rising disproportionately in modern civilization. In the USA, young unmarried men are now 28% celibate which has almost tripled in the past 10 years. Celibacy and increasing isolation between the genders will pose problems for both genders and the stability of society. Japan's society is beginning to destabilize as now among the young & unmarried, 42% of men and 44% of women are virgins. Without relationships, mental health suffers, childbirths drop, and men drop out of society altogether.

What can be done about inceldom?
There are no easy solutions to the challenges facing our society. Incels have no consensus on solutions. But most tend to agree that a social shift towards a society that treats serious long-term monogamous relationships as a worthy and noble goal would be a start, rather than the ""pump-and-dump"" dynamic being facilitated by dating apps like Tinder, which benefits the top men and leaves most men completely out with no opportunities at all.

What next?
Here's a short YouTube compilation of academics discussing incel-related issues if you're interested.

Does longterm inceldom destroy a man's pairbonding ability?,Serious,Divergent_Integral,"Sep 26, 2021",32000,208,"In my case, I'm afraid it has. If an attractive foid were to land on my doorstep today, I simply wouldn't know what to do with her, nor how to handle any kind of intimite relationship with her. All the adversity I've experienced over the last 20 years of trying to find a romantic partner (I'm an oldcel at 37) have definitely put a damper on my belief in things like ""love"" and romantic relationships. The youthful fire and enthusiasm with which I would have greeted any woman into my life have long left me. Additionally, taking the blackpill has severely diminished my tolerance for the usual annoying foid behavior and mannerisms. I often look with amazement at my bluepill normie male friends tolerating all this crap from their ""loved ones""."
"Autistic women perceived more favorably than autistic men, and people are more willing to talk to them than autistic men, multiple studies show",JFL,Edmund_Kemper,"Jun 6, 2022",15000,122,"Introduction:

Participants in multiple studies perceived autistic women more favorably than autistic men and are more willing to hang out with or talk to autistic women than autistic men. In fact, participants perceived NT women more favorably than NT men and were more willing to hang out with NT women than NT men, but preferred NT men over autistic women and autistic women over autistic men. They found this to be true even when controlling for masking which autistic women often are better at doing (which causes underdiagnosis). They concluded it's possible that being a woman made someone more socially desirable than lacking autism traits.

Study 1




Prior research has shown that less favourable first impressions are formed of autistic adults by non-autistic observers. Autistic females may present differently to autistic males and could engage in more camouflaging behaviours, which could affect these first impressions. However, research has not yet tested for gender differences in the first impressions of autistic adults. In the current study, non-autistic observers (n = 205) viewed either 10-sec video clips or text transcripts in the context of a mock job interview by 10 autistic females and 10 autistic males, matched to 10 non-autistic females and 10 non-autistic males. They then rated each stimulus on personality traits (e.g., awkwardness) and behavioural intentions (e.g., “I would start a conversation with this person”). Non-autistic observers were blind to diagnostic status of the individuals in either modality. Results showed that first impressions were less favourable overall of autistic adults in the video modality. Furthermore, autistic females were rated more favourably than autistic males in the video modality across most traits—but autistic females were also rated less favourably than both non-autistic females and males. Some judgements were also made in the text modality, whereby more favourable first impressions were made of autistic males on the basis of speech content.

In total, 53 males and 74 females were recruited; one male was transgender and categorised according to their identified gender. Participants were aged 18 to 40 years (males: M = 27.17, SD = 6.05, females: M = 24.08, SD = 5.51). They were required to have no ASC, or any uncorrected visual or hearing impairments, and to speak English as their first language. These criteria ensured the participant-raters were similar to the participants being observed (hereafter referred to as participant-stimuli) in terms of age and cultural background.

Click to expand...

20 autistic women (mean age=25.45, SD=7.9), 20 autistic men (mean age=25.85, SD=6.06), 20 NT women (mean age=27.75, SD=5.82) and 20 NT men (mean age=27.80, SD=5.94) were rated by participants.

RESULTS







STUDY 2

10 autistic men and 10 autistic women (mean age=22.75, SD=3.7) and 10 NT men and 10 NT women (mean age=23.35, SD=4.61) were stimuli participants to be rated and observant participants were 167 women (81.5%), and 38 men (18.5%) with a mean age of 20.58 (SD=3.96). In the video modality, there were 89 females (81.7%) and 20 males (18.3%) with a mean age of 20.46 (SD = 3.61) years, and in the text modality, there were 78 females (81.3%) and 18 males (18.8%) with a mean age of 20.71 (SD = 4.32) years. Gender of observer was controlled for in all analyses. 28 participants (13.7%) reported that they had a family member with an autism diagnosis, and none had a diagnosis of autism themselves. It seems like text is an easy way to mask autism, so no differences are found in people's perceptions when it comes to text speech.






STUDY 3

15 autistic girls (mean age=10.89, SD=2.3), 25 autistic boys (mean age=12.07, SD=3.27), 25 autistic girls (mean age=10.23, SD=2.7), and 28 autistic boys (mean age=9.44, SD=1.89) were matched on IQ. Participants completed a 5-minute “get-to- know-you” conversation with a new young adult acquaintance. Immediately after the conversation, confederates rated participants on a variety of dimensions. Our primary analysis compared conversation ratings between groups (ASD boys, ASD girls, NT boys, NT girls). The confederates were 18 college women and 3 college men. 

Results: Autistic girls were rated more positively than autistic boys by novel conversation partners (better perceived social communication ability), despite comparable autism symptom severity as rated by expert clinicians (equivalent true social communication ability). Boys with ASD were rated more negatively than typical boys and typical girls by novel conversation partners as well as expert clinicians. There was no significant difference in the first impressions made by autistic girls compared to typical girls during conversations with a novel conversation partner, but autistic girls were rated lower than typical girls by expert clinicians.





Notice how people rated NT women more positively than NT men and were more willing to hang out with NT women than NT men. They also rated autistic women better than autistic men, but didn't rate autist women as positively as NT men. Explained here:

""The current study makes a unique contribution in understanding how gender influences first impressions. Although autistic females were rated more favourably than autistic males across most traits, they were rated less favourably than non-autistic females and non-autistic males across numerous traits. While some prior research has reported no gender differences in camouflaging behaviour [Cage et al., 2018; Hull et al., 2017], Lai et al. [2017] argue that autistic females may camouflage with greater success than autistic males. However, the current findings do not necessarily support this hypothesis. Rather, they suggest that autistic females do have a differ- ent social presentation to autistic males, and because non-autistic females were also rated more positively than non-autistic males, there could be a “protective female effect” rather than camouflaging effect. This protective effect may relate to socialisation or biological differences [Hyde, 2014] that prompt the perceiver to view females more positively. Although males and females are more similar than they are different on psychological variables, Hyde [2005] discusses how assumptions are often made about gender which impacts on outcomes, from the workplace to relationships. Gendered expectations could bias the perceptions of the social abilities of autistic indi- viduals, which may further relate to camouflaging [Dean, Harwood, & Kasari, 2017]. Simply presenting as female could promote positive first impressions, but perceivers are still sensitive to autistic differences in social presentation. Interestingly, autistic females in our sample had higher RAADS scores than autistic males, indicative of more autistic characteristics. Despite this, the autistic females were perceived more positively than autistic males. Thus, we cannot rule out that autistic females were camouflaging their autistic characteristics to a greater extent. It should be noted, however, that the current study did not measure the camouflaging strategies of the stimuli participants, which future research should do to further test camouflaging efficacy. Since autistic females were still negatively judged in comparison to non-autistic females and males, any camouflaging strategies undertaken by autistic females do not necessarily translate into more positive first impressions. It may also be the case that autistic males camouflage but are not as skilled in doing so, which could contribute to more negative first impressions. Nonetheless, in terms of effect sizes, some of the biggest differences were noted between autistic females and non-autistic females, suggesting that negative first impressions of autistic females remain to be substantial.""

CONCLUSION

It seems like even when controlling for masking, autistic women still are perceived more positively and people are more willing to hang out with them. Lots of evidence shows that autistic women aren't particularly less likely than NT people to experience relationships and sex but autistic men are. When searching on Google, i found a good amount of anecdotal evidence that many autistic women prefer dating NT men. Although autistic women are more likely to be victims of intimate partner violence and unwanted sexual experiences, the perpetrators could be NT men.

Are Women Programmed to Cheat?,Theory,Overdosed,"Jul 1, 2021",18000,114,"Is extra-pair copulation (EPC or infidelity) by women currently adaptive? Or, does women's EPC currently advance women's reproductive success (RS)? An evolved adaptation may be currently nonadaptive and even maladaptive because the current ecological setting in which it occurs differs from the evolutionary historical setting that was the selection favoring it. An adaptation will be adaptive currently when the current ecological setting is the selection pressure that molded it.

For centuries it was held that women were the arbitors of monogamy, wishing for an individual man for each individual woman for prosparity & romance. But increasingly, not even low-tier normies are amused.
Let the article above's paragraph be the basis for our discussion-Do women tend to cheat? If so, is it based on genetic design or simply a reaction to their current enviroment?




Hormone analysis showed that the calling behaviour of copulating females was unrelated to their fertile period and likelihood of conception. Instead, females called significantly more while with high-ranking males, but suppressed their calls if high-ranking females were nearby. Copulation calling may therefore be one potential strategy employed by female chimpanzees to advertise receptivity to high-ranked males, confuse paternity and secure future support from these socially important individuals.

The general consensus that female apes (including human ones) engage in copulation vocalization (or moaning) to attract other males (especially chads), so to promote sperm competition and to ""confused paternity"". It's not completely unsubconscious either.
That ancient strategy might help explain the following article.



We examined how sperm respond to follicular fluid, a source of human sperm chemoattractants, from either their partner or a non-partner female when experiencing a simultaneous or non-simultaneous choice between follicular fluids. We report robust evidence under these two distinct experimental conditions that follicular fluid from different females consistently and differentially attracts sperm from specific males. This chemoattractant-moderated choice of sperm offers eggs an avenue to exercise independent mate preference.

https://www.bionews.org.uk/page_150196
This phenomena strongly suggest that women (specifically their eggs) had to engage in multiple extra-pair copulations, otherwise, it wouldn't as selected and universal. This may additionally explain why humans participate in sperm competition, developed foreskin, and why their phelluses' length is long relative to their size (compared to other animals).



Concealed estrus is present in women as evidenced by men’s limited ability (compared to other male mammals) to detect estrus, women’s limited behavioral changes (compared to other female mammals) during estrus, and estrous women’s efforts to limit male mate guarding. Evidence supports the hypothesis that concealed estrus is adaptation that functions in extra-pair-bond copulation to cuckold the main partner in service of better genes for offspring, while maintaining the main partner’s material benefits. Research findings indicate that women’s estrogen-based sexual ornaments honestly signal residual reproductive value.

In addition to confusing paternity and promoting spermicide/competition, Mountainbikecel noted that vaginal discharge (cervical mucus) resembles seminal fluid. Researchers found that cervical mucus's consecration peaks during ovulation.




The woman-picked Peak Day was the same as the referent day in 25% of 117 cycles, within ±1 day in 58% of cycles, ±2 days in 84%, ±3 days in 87%, and ±4 days in 92%. The ±1 day and ± 4 days' agreement was 50% and 90% for the expert-picked and 47% and 87% for the computer-picked Peak Day, respectively.

Women's daily tracking of cervical mucus is a low-cost alternative for identifying the estimated day of ovulation.

Women's daily tracking of cervical mucus is a low-cost alternative for identifying the estimated day of ovulation.




pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov




This is relevant to the fact women prefer extra-pair mates during ovulation.



Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that women's preference for the odour of men with low fluctuating asymmetry (a correlate of testosterone-facilitated trait size and developmental stability) increases with the probability of conception across the menstrual cycle. Symmetrical men report more extra-pair copulation partners, and extra-pair copulation rates peak in midcycle.

Women not using oral/hormonal contraceptives report greater sexual interest in extra-pair men and fantasize more about them than their pair-bonded mate when conception is likely, near ovulation, than when conception is unlikely, during the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle

(Gangestad, Thornhill, and Garver, 2002).
Piecing these correlations together, cervical mucus is perhaps designed to accommodate the conception that women naturally secret seminal-like fluids, so to reduce suspicions when women chose to have extra-pair relations.

But as women become older, their menstrual cycle less frequent and influencial. You might conclude once they reach a certain age, women will have weaker tendency for EPC. Unfortunately, their monogamous loyalty doesn't get better with time.



As men age, their testosterone levels gradually decrease; women’s levels rise. Going into their thirties, women get hairier, their voices deepen, and they behave more assertively. And, in the author’s words, “it’s also quite common for them to experience a dramatic increase in their desire for other men.”

(Langley cites Theresa Crenshaw’s The Alchemy of Love and Lustand Michael Liebowitz’s The Chemistry of Love on these matters.)

Women view masculine's faces as a measurement for attractiveness and type of partnerships. However, they sexually interact with both and different levels of satisfaction.



More symmetrical men should also be preferred as women’s extra-pair mates (i.e., mates chosen by women who already have primary mates, regardless of whether the man has a primary mate).

Bellis and Baker(1990) found preceisely this pattern in a sample of British women. If women’s patterns of extra-pair sex thus favor the sperm of extra-pair mates, this effect might be mediated by women’s preferences for specific attributes valued in extra-pair partners, especially those associated with symmetry.

women use short-term mating to evaluate men as potential long-term partners or for mate-switching. Buss and Schmitt (1993) have found that women place greater emphasis on men’s physical attractiveness and physical prowess when evaluating them for possible short-term relationships.

Baker and Bel lis (1995) report that women who have both an in-pair (primary) partner and an extra-pair partner have patterns of orgasms that facilitate the retention of sperm from the extra-pair partner. If Baker and Bell is are right, indicators of a partner’s genetic fitness should be cues that lead women to have more frequent sperm-retaining orgasms during extra-pair sex.

Women experienced more orgasms if their partner was more symmetrical, r52.27. More important, high sperm-retention orgasms (i.e., those occurring close to ejaculation; Baker &Bellis 1995) were significantly correlated with the men’s degree of symmetry. Aside from their partner’s physical attractiveness, no other male feature correlated with the frequency of female orgasms.

the researchers found that if a woman has an orgasm (and that orgasm might indeed include uterine contractions) soon after her male partner, she literally sucks sperm into her reproductive tract. If she has no orgasm, or orgasms after the man, she retains much less sperm.

This has been attributed to lack of sexual satisfaction of females by their husbands due to either, their genetic make-up, age, socio-culture and means of survival. Physiological sexual differences between men and women also support the cuckold relationship as the ideal for marriage.

As a result, a woman's increasing sexual appetite, due to her biologically age-based sex drive, gives her greater sexual needs than her husband. She needs more sexual encounters, longer sexual encounters and more orgasms than her spouse.

Take all these in account the fact women are more comfortable to not use a condom with attractive men, so the likelihood of being cuckolded after 48hrs of intercourse is significant for long-term partners.
Perhaps men have mechanisms detect adultery.

It's no secret that women utilize maquillage to show fidelity which signals of sexual availability. Anyone who goes outside knows that women use cosmetics, even if they're married. Further proving the point of this thread.

Using the same face database but with a new set of participants, we also replicated previous findings of above-chance accuracy for opposite-sex faces, but only for women rating men's faces and not men rating women's faces. Taken together, both men and women showed above-chance accuracy for men's faces but not women's faces.

In women, vocal parameters did not predict infidelity intention or relationship commitment [unlike men]. Taken together, this study suggests that vocal characteristics predict infidelity intention and relationship commitment in men but not in women. The current findings have important implications for research on voice in the mating-related domain.

Both of these statements may suggest that women have evolved to trick long-term partners into believing being they're faithful to decrease suspicion of infidelity. Women's ability to conceal infidelity is so affective, other females can't tell if they're being fooled. This capability may also be a by-product of social/emotional intelligence.




complex quantitative genetic traits such as personality are likely to depend on hundreds of genes. such that a complete sex-speciﬁc regulation of allelic effects at all these loci will be difﬁcult, if not impossible, to achieve. The example of human inﬁdelity (Figure 3) is particularly striking in that respect. A vast number of genes are likely to affect each personality component that will,in turn, inﬂuence the probability of engaging in extra-pair mating.

You may assume that this is more in support of equalitarianism, until you stop to  'which one of the two sexes is the most social/extroverted'? Men are globally known to keep to themselves, while women on the other hand, follow the people. (This dimorphism has to do with differences in serotonin and estrogen.)

And speaking of genes, we already pinned three genetic causes why women tend to cheat. Behaviours like extroversion may just allow more opportunities to copulate with extra-pair mates.

It had a lasting impact.








[STUDY] More women than men have added their DNA to the human gene pool


Here's the proof that since the dawn of humankind chads are having all the fun.. ""'More of the women were reproducing than men. This often happens in human societies, because not all men are able to afford wives, or sometimes a few men will have many wives', Professor Stoneking said.""...

Regression analysis showed that age was positively related to the number of children. Age at first intercourse, in turn, was negatively related to the number of children, suggesting that earlier loss of virginity predicts more children. Midpoint of sleep and sleep duration contributed to the regression model with people being later chronotypes having fewer children, and shorter sleep duration was linked with more children. Extroversion was positively correlated with number of children, as was the long-term relationship orientation. Propensity of going out and lifetime number of sexual partners were negatively correlated.

Do the math, those who are extroverted have more children and want long-term partners, at the same time, they also tend to commit inﬁdelity. As I've already pointed out, women tend to be extroverted. It's not rocket science.

I've already demonstrated (in a previous link), it's been well attested that women's estrogen to dopamine activation not only makes them more prone to addiction, it also makes them more disinterested in sex with their LTRs.

That is to say, because sexual boredom is a strong cue for sexual infidelity, people who use this cue prior to engaging in sexual infidelity may experience relatively low guilt, as they believe that they have forewarned the mate.

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01461672972310004
Many of you might feel justified to put blame the wives' sexual boredom on the husbands, the obvious objection to this, girls are participating in sexual behaviour as early as 10-12 yo, so by the time they've reached 18-20 (more so once they've “settled down”) the only thing of sexual novelty to them: is fornicating with new people. That's not something LTR individuals provide within themselves. This may explain why modern women have low satisfaction and sexual interest after marriage. Plus, this phenomena isn't unique to heterosexual couples. So to blame men for women's sexual boredom is a negative IQ thing to say.

(Women are innocuous, little angels, therefore if they cheat, it must be because their partners are shit.)>
Ignoring girls' biological tendency to cuck guys, what determines a ""shit""ty male partner so to deny him sex and betray him behind his back? Being a misogynist? Having a criminal history? Low IQ? Withholding love?
Soyboys need to understand, women often don't cheat as punishment or really as a means to protect herself. Rather



Women made sense of their affairs as a space in which to reclaim power and to have experiences for no one else but themselves. Women considered the temporary nature of their affairs to be liberating, since affairs could serve as an arena in which women set the rules.

Walker found evidence that women achieved a non-normative‘ perspective shift’ regarding beliefs about monogamy and relationships. Rather than blame their individual partners for dissatisfaction in their primary sexual relationships, some women problematized monogamy as a societal expectation.

You could argue this is all part of modernity and that women are more miserable in the post sexual revolution, then you're going to reconcle that women who partipate in extra-pair affars are generally happier.



We found that monogamous people reported slightly lower sexual satisfaction and lower orgasm rates than those who are consensually non-monogamous (CNM). Moreover, the type of CNM in which a person engages is important: swingers consistently reported higher sexual satisfaction than monogamous individuals, whereas those in open relationships had equivalent levels of satisfaction to those in monogamous relationships. Relationship satisfaction did not differ between CNM and monogamous groups.

You may not care so much about sexual activity, rather, you care more about companionship and life time commitments. Too bad.



CNM partners reported more lifetime sexual partners than individuals in monogamous relationships. In addition, compared with monogamous partners, CNM partners were more likely to (i) report using condoms during intercourse with their primary partner; (ii) report using condoms during intercourse with extradyadic partners; and (iii) report having been tested for STIs. Approximately one-quarter of monogamous partners reported sex outside of their primary relationship, most of whom indicated that their primary partner did not know about their infidelity. The percentage of participants reporting previous STI diagnoses did not differ across relationship type.

Monogamy may not even natural to women (or females in general). It's more likely that monogamy was enforced to maintain civility, which created modern civilation. If this is a fact, then we should expect to see the degregation of social cohension if monogamy is no longer enforced.



Experimental results support an interplay of different factors in the evolution of social monogamy – female dispersion and availability and breeding season duration – and suggests that polygamy will only evolve in populations with a female-biased operational sex ratio or one where cheating is common.

Though the surge in violence affected all the races and both genders, it was most dramatic among black men, whose annual homicide rate had shot up by the mid-1980s to 72 per 100,000. 
The flood of violence from the 1960s through the 1980s reshaped American culture, the political scene, and everyday life.

The 1960s decivilizing process affected the choices of individuals as well as policy-makers. Many young men decided that they ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more, and instead of pursuing a respectable family life, they hung out in all-male packs that spawned the familiar cycle of competition for dominance, insult or minor aggression, and violent retaliation. The sexual revolution, which provided men with plentiful sexual opportunities without the responsibilities of marriage, added to this dubious freedom.

There are those who wish to return to patriarchy where people engage in arrange marriages or pay for dowries to avoid the likelihood of cuckoldry. That may not be sufficient.



In this sample, 31.8 per cent of Himba women had at least one extra-pair (omoka) birth during their lifetime. This accounts for 17.6 per cent of all marital births. Of the 36 women who had at least one extra-pair birth, 20 had one, nine had two and six had three or more. This is a conservative estimate of EPP in this population due to reporting bias and the exclusion of children who died.

Women in ‘love matches’ were significantly more faithful to their husbands than women in arranged marriages. There were no omoka children born within love matches (0 of 79), compared with 23.2 per cent omoka children from arranged marriages . This is highly unlikely to be due to chance (p < 0.001).

Mate Guarding is Pointless Long Term


You may feel compelled to constrict women's dual mating strategy after reading my post, however, several studies prove that might be a useless endeavour: When the adult sex ratio is male-biased, monogamous strategies are strongly favored. However, this is only the case if mate guarding is...




incels.is




Avoiding arranged marriages may seem like a better solution, rather we allow people to chose their partner indepenantly, however, we see similar rates extra-pair mating in sexual liberated counties, even in conservative circles.




20% to 40% of American women report having cheated on their partner, and prevalence estimates of offspring from extra-pair copulations range from 1% to 30% across cultures, averaging around 10%.

15% of women between the ages of 16 and 24 years reported having concurrent sexual relationships, and Gallup, Burch, and Berens Mitchell (2006) found 25% of women in a college sample reported at least one extra-pair copulation.

The result of this study is that cheating strategies by rural women (in the Trenggulunan Village, Ngasem District, Bojonegoro Regency) have two ways, namely first; meeting strategies which include setting schedules, planning communication, meeting safe times, meeting activities, and duration of meetings. Second: advanced strategies which include changing names on cellphones, hiding evidence of infidelity, returning to their homes separately, and maintaining relationships with cheating partners.

Participants (N = 459) from India and the USA were apportioned a ‘mate budget’ to construct their ideal short- and long-term partners.
Genetic traits were favoured for short-term relationships; material traits were favoured for long-term relationships. However, women with a more restricted sexuality preferred short-term mates who closely resembled their long-term preferences.

Both of our methods therefore estimated a substantially lower historical EPP rate for Flanders than the 8–30% per generation suggested by previous studies based on behavioural data on rates of EPCs in Western Europe and given the absence of reliable contraceptive methods.

This suggests that EPP rates have not changed substantially during recent centuries in Western European populations, and have not greatly decreased after the large-scale introduction of contraceptives in the 1960s.

Bluepillers might be tempted to say if 'I accept single mothers since they're maybe less likely to cuck me afterwards, because they passed having their ""fun""'. Well, nature doesn't seem to agree.



comparing the distributions of extra-pair paternity (EPP) rates shows that there are proportionally more cooperatively breeding species with EPP levels >30% (20% of cooperatively breeding species, than those socially monogamous species with biparental care (14% of socially monogamous species), although this difference was not statistically significant.

Stop for a moment and just think about from the single mothers' perspective. Why in the world do you think they want to stop sleeping around after you've shown that you're willing to accept them as they are (even after fucking hundreds of chads and caring for their kids regardless, especially if they can divorce rape you if you object)?

You would think that having one biological child of a twin implies the other is also yours'. Unfortunately-



It is estimated that at least one dizygotic (DZ) twin maternity in twelve is preceded by superfecundation (the fertilization of two ova by sperm from different coitions). Presumably this parameter varies from population to population eg. with coital rates and rates of double ovulation. Sometimes superfecundation occurs by two different men. The frequency with which this occurs must depend on rates of infidelity (promiscuity). It is suggested that among DZ twins born to married white women in the U.S., about one pair in 400 is bipaternal.

One could suggest that women's innate desire to cuckold their long-term mate is just a biological adaptation to search for ""good genes"". This hypothesis fails to consider that many of the characteristics of these ""good genes"" are directed by the mother's epigenetic environment:
https://incels.is/threads/mothers-are-why-incels-exist.301613/
potential cuckoldry from whom are supposedily the ""most empathic people"" fathers' should trust is the reality they have to face, even though said people may not benefit from it.



In studies that solely looked at couples who obtained paternity testing because paternity was being disputed, there are higher levels; an incidence of [fraud was] 17% to 33% (median of 26.9%).

From biological processes, behaviour, sociological benefits, and genes, all the data points that women intrinsically desire for extra-pair copulation, and they're genetically equipped for secure extra-pair young to term & development.
This adaptation perhaps was useful in our ancient past where genetically dissimilar mates were difficult to obtain in a tribe solely women (like herds of elephants) or completely family group so to avoid incest. But, humanity has reach beyond those models in favor of monogamy/patriarchal-centric polygamy, which strongly contributed the construction of modern civilization.
In light of this, we can say that women's sexual strategy is maladaptive because the current ecological setting, if not detrimental to it. But as we all are well aware, you can't negotiate with female desire, so until something changes, we all have to move forward knowing that women are programmed to cheat by design and environment.

Why Blackpilling Normies Always Fails and how most Incels are not Blackpilled,Blackpill,GeckoBus,"Oct 28, 2023",13000,138,"Why Blackpilling Normies Always Fails and how most Incels are not Blackpilled


Summary:
Blackpilling Normies always fails.
When Normies try to understand Incels, they never tackle the blackpill itself.
In this thread, we investigate the reasons behind this and shock everyone by exposing
how most incels are just turncoat Tonys, ready to drop the incel moniker in a hearbeat.

Stay Tuned.

1. Introduction: Normies Do Not Understand Us
2. What the Blackpill is
3. What the Blackpill is not
4. Why Normies Fail to Understand Us
5. How a lot of Incels are not Blackpilled
6. Final Thoughts and Doctors Orders
7. Mega.nz link with some goodies

Blurp:
When I first took the blackpill I was excited to know the truth and tried to blackpill people in real life.
All I got was confusion, hostility, gaslighting, social consequences.
I then found out there was a subreddit called r/IncelTear that relentlessly denied the blackpill despite all the evidence.

I watched an IncelTV video someone called Brendio tried to give valid argumentation to the bluepillers he was talking to.
But all they did was mute him and moralfag before kicking him off the stream.
They did not even attempt to make any arguments themselves.

My biggest question was why?
How could they not even engage us when we had so much data on our side?
I've spent the last 5 months or so heavily thinking about this.

There is not much information on why people deny the blackpill so I took it upon myself to find out.
This thread is a collection of information I have come across to make sense of it all.

I hope that this thread gives a good outline to why we get gaslighted about the blackpill.
Thankyou for reading my thoughts.

1. Normies Do Not Understand Us

Baffling to us, Normies always reduce incels and the adjacent blackpill to
a form of rabid emotionalism.

For some reason they reduce the entire subject to Incels being a bunch of angry men.
They act as if incels have no reasons.

(Ironically, they also reduce it to a womans-issue only, thus proving gynocracy exists but I digress)

Even when many of us have tried to expose Normies to the Blackpill.
We linked data, we printed out studies - to no avail.
What is the problem with Normies?

It's clearly not about a lack of good information.

What is happening?
Why are they doing this?
That shall be answered now.

But first, definitions my friends:

2. What the blackpill is:

The blackpill is a body of value-neutral data-points derived from academic research, historical sources and anecdotes.
These findings highlight certain behaviors of both genders.
Since the information is value neutral, meaning it contains no value judgements about women or men,
there is no reason to ascribe any attributes to it, i.e. ""nihilstic,"" ""fatalistic,"" ""self-loathing,"" ""mysognistic,"" etc.


That's it. That's the blackpill.

3. What the blackpill is not:

- It is not an ideology.
- It is not connected to emotions.
- It does not make any value-judgements about either gender (not that it could, it has no personhood).
- The blackpill is not a fatalistic belief system, dreamt up by disatisfied men that hoped for more in life.

In fact, the blackpill is fit for marriage with any worldview whatsoever.
For example, a Christian worldview could easily incorporate the blackpill by simply explaining human behavior
as corrupted by the fall of man in Genesis.
This would be a negative interpretation, suffice to say.

A scientist could incorporate the blackpill into evolutionary psychology.
This would be a neutral take.

What about a postive interpration?
Yes, it is possible!
From the perspective of someone who profits of the blackpill, it is absolutely beautiful my friends!
Imagine a psychopath, or the powers that be... or a marketing agent perhaps...
They would ADORE the blackpill! It would make their life so much easier!

Maybe it has already...

You see friends, my point is this: The blackpill is just this: Nothing.






It pertains to be nothing, it judges not, it holds nobody accountable.
So the question remains: Why is it portrait as such when Normies engage with Incels?

4. Why Normies Fail to Understand Us

Morality.
It's morality.
Note, I am not saying any party involved is morally superior or inferior.
That is not the argument I am making.

No, I think the problem is the worldview and resulting value judgements of Normies compared to the average incel.
We simply value completely different things and thus interpret everything differently.

Women and Normies interpretation of reality breaks down to self-benefit.
Everything is evaluated first by one criteria:
""Does it benefit me?""
If not, it has no value.

This is also how propaganda works.
You just frame things so normies think it benefits them.
""Your rights to do xyz are being taken away.""
Suddenly people care about things they did not even know existed a moment ago.

Here are some common observable normie tropes with this pattern:

a) ""You are not entitled to anything."" 
This is simply logically fallacious. If the statement holds universally true then the person making it would not be entitled
to making it. Are you entitled to your opinion? It is self refuting.

However, this is not why they say it. It does not come from a logical place.
It's a form of violence. They are basically saying, ""fuck you, take it up the ass and shut up.""
It's a form of might is right. If something benefits them they feel they deserve it and you are not to critize them for that.

If you anyone wants to study up further on this, here are some interesting things to look into:






Self-serving bias - Wikipedia







en.wikipedia.org









Fundamental attribution error - Wikipedia







en.wikipedia.org









Depressive realism - Wikipedia







en.wikipedia.org





b) ""That's none of your business.""
Ditto. Is it your business to tell me that? What my business is, is none your business. It's circular reasoning when applied consistently.

c) ""If you don't do xzy you are a bad person""
""If you don't give money to soup kitchens, you hate poor people.""
""If you say something I don't like about women, you hate women.""

They don't care about poor people, it's manipulation.

As an autist, it took me years to understand this. I am 26 years old and I still struggle
with people not saying what they mean.

Their verbal output is not indentical to their internal monologue.
However, we can approximate based on their actions.

One example of this that we already mentioned is that normies defend things that benefit them as if they are moral goods.
If it benefits them, them they win in their own head, and because they win (benefit), they verbally express that its ""valuable.""
But this does not mean it's actually good in their eyes. It just means it benefits them.

Acting Good = Being Good.
""Anything that benefits me is good.""

With women in particular this goes as far as ""not being punished = being rewarded.""





Your browser is not able to display this video.




This is also why the predominant female power fantasy in movies is playing the villian and getting away with it.
In the recent hitshow ""Fleabag,"" beloved by women, the POV main character is a essentially
a narcisstic psycho who treats people in her life as objects, especially men.

For instance, she is aroused by a priest and simply lables him ""hot priest.""
This is how women actually see people. Utilities.
Even Chad is only viewed as a utility - ""hot guy.""

Suffice to say, by the end of the show the evil main foid just walks off, no punishment, no consequences.
Art imitates life.

Scientifically this has been noted prior by people like Kohlberg
(shoutout to @Cybersex is our hope who first made me aware of this with his thread ):





Please look at the above picture.

Kohlberg tried to quantify morality in a model.
Most people are stuck on the lower 1-3 levels, especially women.

Everything is about self-benefit and punishment reward.
You know how kids go through that annoying phase where they pester their parens with questions?
That phase never stops.

Grown people still turn to authority figures for all questions in life.
That's where they get their morality from.
They test boundaries, like kids. If they don't get punished, they feel a rush.
Nothing changes since childhood.
It's just more subtle.

One example from Nazi Germany:
Most germans did not care about Nazi ideology. Not surprising since most people back then
had like a 6th grade education and began working at 14.

So how did the Nazis activate Normies to support the war effort?
By framing the entire thing through the lense of self-benefit.
Fear in particular.

Just like during the american civil war, most people fighting probably were not ideologically motivated.
Some feared for their homes, some probably thought the army was a great deal.
A lot of guys also said the uniform seemed to attracted bitches, so they joined.

The Nazi Flag is a good example.
It's symbolism escapes most people nowadays, so let me explain:





The red literally is meant to symbolize Communism.
Communism surrounds a small group of Nazis, allmost swallowing them.
Most germans fought because they feared a communist takeover.

You can only manipulate people by appealing to base instincts.

As Edward Bernays wrote in ""Propaganda:""




""The modern propagandist therefore sets to work
to create circumstances which will modify that cus-
tom. He appeals perhaps to the home instinct which
is fundamental.
...

A number of familiar psychological motives were
set in motion in the carrying out of this campaign.
The esthetic, the competitive, the gregarious (much
of the sculpturing was done in school groups), the
snobbish (the impulse to follow the example of a
recognized leader), the exhibitionist, and—last but
by no means least—the maternal""

What he is getting at is that the Propagandist can not create new instincts in people.
It can only appeal to existing ones by attacking or arousing them.
For example, the attacking principle is mostly used on men:





Whereas the arousing principle is mostly used on women.
That's why most products nowadays have cartoon characters on them and why 80-90% of customer purchases are done by women.


Charles Manson is another example.
All the foids that he ""manipulated"" talk about him like he was this high IQ genius.
Meanwhile his male friend had this to say about him:




“I knew the dude,” Troy tells me. “I used to play volleyball with him on the beach at L.A. years ago. He had short hair back then, but even then he was very big with the chicks.”
What was his secret, I asked.
“It was his cock,” says Troy.
“His cock?”
“His cock.”

Just lol.


Going back to Kohlberg and Normies simplistic ""might-is-right"" worldview:
If someone is on a certain stage of moral development, then they project that you are on that level as well.

Incels are the only group that critiques itself due to operating mostly on the higher, principle-based stage of moral development.
In research, this is conflated as incels being ""self-loathing."" In reality, it's just being realistic.

Again, they are applying value judgements to the blackpill.
The value judgement that the blackpill is ""self-loathing,"" ""depressing,"" etc... comes from a worldview
that presupposes that certain things are morally negative. These values are not inherent to the blackpill at all.

To give one example, look at this footnote from a paper on incels:




""I focus on the incel community because it openly embraces male supremacist ideology, hatred of the feminist movement, and the perceived entitlement to sex from women (Silva, Capellan, Schmuhl, & Mills, 2021).""

Click to expand...


Source:


The Sense in Senseless Violence: Male Reproductive Strategy and the Modern Sexual Marketplace as Contributors to Violent Extremism



- supremacy (value judgement)
- hatred (value judgement)
- entitlement (value judgement)

None of this has anything to do with the blackpill.
All of these are presuppositions that come from a very specific worldview that interprets data
in a very specific way. They are not ""brute facts"" at all.

Humans project their worldview onto other people.
""We don't see the world as it is, but as we are.""

The blackpill has nothing to do with value judgments at all. As I said earlier, the blackpill can be outright
invigorating if your worldview interprets it that way.

When we understand this, it becomes clear that it's not Normies fault that they cant be blackpilled.
They dont have the reasoning for it, or rather, their biased self serving worldview simply does not allow certain kind of evidences, because these evidences contradict their unfounded moral pre-suppositions.

We project a sense of justice on normies that doesnt exist
Its not their fault, they just cant think beyond their biased Worldview.

At 32:08 in this clip, known CIA asset and also-happens-to-be-a-famous-writer Kurt Vonnegut
explains how he made the same experience working as an anthropologist:


View: https://youtu.be/eLwe-EFUF-A?t=1928


This is why its impossible to blackpill normies.

From their perspective, where everything is group-dynamics, power-struggles, might-is-right,
When you show them the blackpill, you are asking them to support a group of males viewed as evil, over ALL women. That includes their sisters, cousins, mother, aunts, wives, girlfriends, female friends.

In reality, you are not asking them to support anything though.
It's simply too much too ask. In order to understand the blackpill, you need to put aside bias, self interest etc.

""It's the hallmark of intelligence to be able to entertain a thought without being consumed by it.""
- Some greek faggot

This is also why women deny the blackpill despite obviously knowing about it (obsessed with looks, make up etc).
It does not benefit them to give away their tricks.

Chaps, I can't get into it but I would highly encourage reading the original Milgram Experiment text.









Stanley Milgram - Obedience to Authority_ An Experimental View-Tavistock Publications Ltd (1974).pdf

They basically made people shock someone to death with a little push of authority.
And most normies went along with it, for the reasons I mentioned (lower morality - a priest for example did not go along with it, go figure).


Basically, everything is subjugated to ""benefit or no benefit?""
Lying? Fine, as long as you benefit.
Ignoring or Misrepresenting Evidence? Fine, as long as you benefit.

Everything in their worldview is reduced to utility to the self.
If it does not benefit them, it is useless.

The reason why they don't acknowledge the blackpill when talking about Incels has nothing to do with

- them not getting the blackpill (they do, evidence later)
- them not understanding incels plight
- they don't benefit from agreeing with incels, so they dont

It's about warfare. They project that we use knowledge the same way they do: As a weapon to benefit ourselves.
We don't. Or at least not all of us. I will call you guys out later 

Normies break everything down to a power-struggle.
Punishment vs. Reward.
Victim vs. Opressor.

So from their perspective, the blackpill is...

-> A bunch of shit a bunch of angry men say to get their way.

This is where all their claims come from
- ""incels only want stacies""
- ""incels are entitled""
- ""incels are violent""

None of this shit has anything to do with the blackpill.
They are projecting their infantile ""might-is-right"" morality onto a dataset that has nothing to do with morality at all.
If we go by what Kohlberg illustrated, many people may not even be capable of surpassing this kind of thinking.

They literally believe we only care about the blackpill because it benefits us.
So they jump to the conclusion, ""well, this is all about getting what you want anyway"" -> ""incels are entitled""

This goes into another thing they do: Intentional display.
I said prior, they think acting like a good person = being a good person.

Just imagine a child thinking its good because it follows its parents instructions.
Newsflash: You are not good for acting good. Nobody can act agains their own will, ALL actions are self-serving.

If the children comparison seems derogatory to you, you have learned nothing up to this point.
(pshht, its only derogatory if you dont get what im saying about how worldviews shape value judgements  - you only think its derogatory because you think children are retarded and you dont value them OH NOOO YOU DONT WANT TO THINK THAT DO YOU? BAD BAAD)

This is devastating friends, because it means that we will never, and I mean never, be able to argue with Normies
on a logical basis. Everything we say will be judged through the lense of ""victim vs opressor""
or rather

- the messenger will always judged insead of the message
- they look for the ""why"" not for the ""what"" (as in ""why are incels saying this"" not for ""what are incels actually saying"")

Their worldview simply does not allow for any other outlook.
And if your worldview only permits evidences which prove what you want to believe,
then arguing is pointless.

By this we can deduce that, anyone who claims the blackpill is an ideology exposes themselves as biased, and, you knowk, actually having an ideology.

For instance, if someone sees a datapoint about women or men they don't like, that does not mean the blackpill or incels
are evil or nihilstic.
It just means the datapoint does not jive with their worldview and how they interpret human behavior.

This principle of power superseeding even elementary logic can be seen elsewhere as well.

Take the current israel-hamas conflict.
Most normies couldn't show you Gaza on a map a few day ago.
Suddenly they care about this shit. In a few months, it will be like it never happened. Remember my words.
They only care because right now, virtue signalling about this distant conflict benefits them
""Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia.""

Same for Covid, which essentially only existed in the media.
Ukraine, same shit.
People have already forgotten about Ukraine lmao.

People don't really care about any of this. They care about benefitting themselves.
Studies have shown that virtue signalling about shit like this
is actually indicative of dark triad personality traits.









Signaling virtuous victimhood as indicators of Dark Triad personalities - PubMed


We investigate the consequences and predictors of emitting signals of victimhood and virtue. In our first three studies, we show that the virtuous victim signal can facilitate nonreciprocal resource transfer from others to the signaler.

One of the most krass examples is children.
Society simply does not value children, or there would be no need for orphanages.
All the children would be off the market already.
It's simple market economics. If children were a sought after commodity, they would be sold out.

And in our case, the classic example would be how they always, unfailingly, reduce the entire subject to
""women most affected.""They think catering to foids benefits them.
They look at neutral datapoints and conclude with retarded certainity: ""This is about women.""
It's not. It's not about shit. It's not about anything.

You could easily look at the same blackpills and conclude that most men are retarded
mentally ill fuckshits that are spending billions of shekles on pictures of naked women.

But they don't draw that conclusion, do they?
Exactly.

Your worldview shapes how you interpret reality.

The blackpill is basically a massive Rorschach test.
What do you see in the inkblobs Johnny?
Do you see a bunch of inkblobs (reality) or do you see a woman getting hurt and you dont like that (bias)?

This is why you can not argue with them.
When you talk to normies, you are not debating facts, you are debating paradigms.
Worldviews.
Entire systems of thought.
They don't process information like incels.

To illustrate how it's all just self benefit, look at these examples in which they:


- acknowledge mens plight
- acknowledge lookism
- advocate for actual solutions to these

Basically they admit key points of the blackpill.
Yet when talking to us, they reject them. How come?


a) Yvetlana Vasin

View: https://medium.com/hello-love/stop-saying-looks-dont-matter-7d48d07eea93


Writer.
Openly admits looks matter. Seemingly understand blackpill.
But then you look her up and she runs this match-making service
to sell trophy hoes to trad-copers in the west:

Meet genuine ladies who are looking for love. Register NOW for free and start browsing the profiles of potential partners here at St. Petersburg Women.



saint-petersburg-women.com





So she literally knows that looks matter, but she only uses that konwledge to benefit herself.
Again, they admit looks matter, if it benefits them.

b) STRANGE ÆONS
Shits on incels:

Then gets a nosejob (lookism):

c) Various Looks-Surgery or ""rate-me"" related subreddits





Reddit - Dive into anything







www.reddit.com





On all of these subreddits, you see way more women than men.
The women are getting way more attention.

And on the surgery subreddits, the men are gaslight about their looks
while people literally encourage women to get surgeries.
Again, if it benefits them somehow, they absolutely support the blackpill.

Women are hypocrites. This is warfare to them.
The reason why they don't admit we are right is because their worldview inherently
is anti-male.

d) QOVESStudio


https://www.youtube.com/@QOVESStudio



Youtube channel with 500k subs talking exclusively about lookism.
Comments often talk about how looks affect life.
If we make these points, we are ridiculed though.

e) Ugly deformed kids getting surgery.
Whenever you see some report or gofuckme with a child that got mauled
by a pitbull or something, people violently scream for jutsice and point out
how the looks of the child will negatively affect it - ""i hope he gets surgery
and gets to live a normal life.""

So looks suddenly matter?


f) Female Spending
Going away from lookism a bit here.
In my opinion, you can literally explain the entire blackpill just by using
market economics. Things like skewed gender-ratios have a tremendous impact on society.

Take for instance the fact that women make 80-90% of customer purchases alone.

""Women were responsible for 75-85% of consumer spending in the 1930s.""








Research Guides: Consumer Advertising During the Great Depression: A Resource Guide: Gender and Advertising


This guide explores primary and secondary sources that examine the advertising industry from 1929 to 1933, including advertising agencies, consumer protection groups, and topical sources on gender, race, and radio in advertising.




guides.loc.gov





""Women make up more than half of the U.S. population, and control or influence 85% of consumer spending""








The Purchasing Power of Women: Statistics | Girlpower Marketing


Women control over $20 trillion in world-wide spending. Learn more about the purchasing power of women, from Millennials to Baby Boomers, in various markets

This is devastating.
It means that women get almost half the money they own from men.
It means that women are probably hiding money from their partners.
It means that women are extremely shallow and materialistic, while guys predominately value women
over material goods.

This is a brutal pill and reflects extremely negatively on women, if your worldview is bluepilled.
However, because of the current culture, this seen as positive by normies.
Just look at the ""girlpowermarketing"" link above. It's in the name. ""Girl Power.""

So this seemingly horrific exposure of female nature suddenly becomes morally good, because context.


g) Female Sexual liberation
This one is kind of a funny double standard:
""Women are sexually liberated"" - YAY!
""You're mom is a hoe that got bukkaked on camera."" - NOOOOOOO

The cognitivie dissonance is very funny to me.
You see this with tradcopers and redpillers a lot.
One one hand they advocate for plowing through as many hoes as possible.
But then they tell you ""just find a good wife bro.""
Hilarious.


So please, why do they so readily agree with our points as long as its not us making them?
You should be able to answer that at this point.
It was nothing to do with the blackpill.

They disagree with us not because they think the blackpill is wrong, but because WE are wrong.
The messenger is the message.
Its warfare. They literally think incels are trying to mog them by flexing the blackpills as a tool for their own ends.
Its that stupid.

When the blackpill benefits them, they use it.

They simply cant grasp that there are mind-independent things in the world
that exist outside of some monkey-brained retarded using them for personal gain.
Everything is personal gain for them.

If we re-framed the entire blackpill to fit Normies worldview,
they would be campaigining to put it into legislature right now.
I am not exaggerating.

Now, children of the sun, I must critique you tsk tsk.

5. How most Incels are not Blackpilled

Many of us are guilty of exactly the same shit I just talked about.

To illustrate:
Incels fall into two categories:

a) The smart ones:
The ones that get the above points on a philosophical level.
I would count people like @WorthlessSlavicShit and @Atavistic Autist among them.
They are mostly interested in information hoarding and research.
I would call these ""consistent"" incels, as you could reasonably convince them of anything
as long as your points are valid.

b) The dummies:
These are the ones that gives us a bad name.
They operate exactly like normies do. Might is right, self benefit to the max. To them, the blackpill is inconsequential. It does not even matter.
This is more incels than you would think, unfortunately.

Shocking: Normies attitude towards us IS TRUE - when applied to this group.
These are the droves of greycels that wash up on our shores and then disappear within a few months.
These are the dregs of this forum. They engage in loud displays to signal their bonobo group-adherence to the tribe.

They are ones causing constant in-fighting and witchhunts.
They are the ones that are not even blackpilled and will probably get buxxed in the next 20 years.
If ""It's just a phase mom"" was a person, it would be them.


View: https://youtu.be/dhEfIdXxRuk?t=1032


In this clip, Naama kates, whos been with groups spying on us for years now,
makes this superficially unbelievable assertion:

Most incels leave the blackpill, get buxxed and move on.
When I first heard this it boggled my mind.
How tf can you move on from an observation like ""women are 80% of customers?""

I was projecting friends.
Most greycels, most incels are not even blackpilled.
They come here, thinking this is some edgelord shit and then they act the fool to compete for rank in the
hiearchy here. Once it gets boring they move on.

Normiecels are the scourge of incels and give us a bad rep.

In my ""Masculinity is a social construct"" thread I laid out
how male in-fighting is the norm and how its encouraged by women.









Masculinity is an actual social construct and More - Studies


""You're not a real woman!"" Said no one ever. Why? Why does that only work on men? The answer is two-fold 1. women have inherent value, you can't loose your woman card because being a woman is synonymous with having female flesh. 2. masculinity as its propagated by women and society largely...




incels.is






We are not immune to this.
There is constant fighting on this forum.
Guys, women operate as a very dense hivemind with tentacles everywhere.
They are like a kraken with manifold arms, a beast of immeasurable proportions.
You. Can. Not. Win.

The constant male on male violence we observe on these forums
is literally exactly whats happening in society and why men cant get a foothold against women.
Men compete with men and worship women = 99% of niggas on this forum.

The only people that are fully excempt from this is a handful of autistic niggas
that spend years digging through research papers and other shit
instead of bickering and witchunting on here.

I wish people spend more time actually researching.
One counter to this that will be made: ""The blackpill is complete, there is no new data to be found.""
This is a hypercope.

It reminds of when people in 1900 literally claimed everything that could be invented had already been invented.
source:

The blackpill is not restricted to looks and dating.

- looks = health
- health = nutrition + genetics
- nutrition + health + genetics = global politics (government food recommendatiosn deliberately fucking up populations)
- global polictics = jewpill, new world order whatever
- politics = philosophy
- philosohpy = argumentation, worldviews, sound reasoning
- etc.


everything intersects and connects and the ride never ends.
If you want to come to the fullness of truth, you have to keep learning.
The reason why a lot of incels will not go down that path is because they are normies.
They will move on. They think it doesn't benefit them to dig deeper.


There is so much we could talk about, so much.
We are men, all of us have cool shit to say.
Instead I see retards getting angry because some dude said something mean in a thread.
If it was a foid many of you would simp.
Shame on you!


You should stop fighting and competing with other men.
Especially on this forum.
You never see women do that shit. They are above that with their insane in group preference.

Another thing to consider:

- Normies and Psychologists want the blackpill to become an actual ideology because its easier to control
- They want to hijack the negative parts of male nature (hyper-competitive, bickering, infighting) against us

To that End, they constantly discourage actual research and high-trust actions on these forums.
If you attack other men on here or IRL, you are no better than women and normie men,
that constantly encourage male on male aggression and competition.







6. Final Thoughts and Doctors Orders:

I hope I could illustrate why its impossible for Normies to be blackpilled.
And also, why many incels are not really blackpilled.

Honestly, black pillers and blue pillers just shouldnt talk to eachother, as communication is not possible
Women will NEVER say that looks matter unless it benefits them somehow.

And the final pill for today:
If people were capable of understanding these problems they would have already been fixed.
If there was a solution, there would be no market.

Janet Mason




""In my case, size does matter. It is certainly no big secret to anyone who knows me, either personally or through my web site and videos, that I am a true ""size queen""...there's almost nothing that gets me turned on faster (or makes me orgasm harder and more frequently) than a really long, thick dick. Some men find that arousing. ""I just want to meet a hot guy, fuck like animals and go our separate ways, exhausted and satisfied. And for that, I'll take a guy with a big dick any day...and the bigger, the better. ""... There was something indescribably pleasurable about feeling more ""filled"" with a big cock when we made love that made my orgasms more intense than any I'd ever experienced with lesser-endowed men."" http://www.janetmasonblog.com/2007/12/why-i-am-size-queen.html
""Yes, I am definitely what you'd call a 'size queen' when it comes to cocks. I simply love them big...and the bigger, the better! My husband Steve has a big dick, and he was the first guy I was ever with who was hung well above average...so I guess you could say he gets full credit or blame for my fetish, depending on your viewpoint. For me, there is nothing quite like a truly huge cock - which I define as over 8 honest, actual inches, not the usual exaggerated 'Internet Inches' - to get my juices flowing, both literally and figuratively. I still tremble with lust, get 'butterflies in my stomach' and feel the burning flush of pure animal desire in my face, chest and pussy whenever I'm face-to-face with one or see one in photos or videos.""
http://www.janet-exposed.com/guests/faq.htm#cock_size
What do you like most about being a hotwife?
""I like all the huge cocks Steve finds for me and the thought of all that cum from so many willing donors. As a size queen and a cum queen, that alone would be great. But I also really like feeling so spoiled and pampered by Steve - it makes me feel very feminine and adored. I get the best of both worlds - the stability of a loving traditional relationship with a husband and kids, plus the uninhibited sexual freedom and exploration that is always available whenever we want it.""
So size does matter to you?
""Yes, it matters a lot. I do NOT pretend to speak for other women here, but to me it absolutely does - some women don’t care. I like them both extra long and extra thick - not just one or the other. The feeling of being so filled up and nearly being split in two drives me over the edge again and again. Many guys who are insecure about their cock size tend to say 'It’s better to have a lover with skills and consideration in bed rather than a guy with a big dick!', but the whole 'Would you prefer a man with a big cock or a man who is good in bed?' thing is a ludicrously false model of thought, as it assumes that men with large penises cannot possibly have any skill and consideration in bed and that men with smaller penises automatically do have it. It just gets funnier the more one thinks about it. Skill and consideration are learned behaviors ergo, anyone can obtain them. But penis size is obviously not learned or otherwise obtainable it’s an accident of birth. For some women, myself included, a man who is skilled and considerate in bed AND packs a huge cock is far preferable to a man who is skilled and considerate in bed but has a smaller cock (all other things being equal). And here’s another thing I’ve found - many of my female friends say the same thing in private to other women, even if they wouldn’t dare admit it to their husbands or boyfriends. Fortunately, Steve and I have the kind of relationship wherein we can both be totally honest about our turn-ons and fantasies, so I don’t have to lie about it. Besides, he’s got a bigger-than-average one himself, so he’s not insecure about his size, and that helps.""
What is your favorite sexual act?
""It’s definitely a face full of cum, a big load in my pussy, having my asshole licked and sucked until I orgasm, having my toes sucked and being fucked REALLY hard for a long time by a big cock.""
http://www.hotwifeblog.com/2005/09/13/janet-mason-interviewed/
""I am a self-professed Size Queen. Every time I'm treated to one I get giddy like a schoolgirl and that's when I go into 'cock worship' mode! I never, ever get tired of or feel blasé toward huge cocks. It's just a huge part of who I am, no pun intended.""

""I’ve dated guys that were on the smaller/more normal side and have had good sex. BUT It’s not the same as having good sex with a guy that has a big dick. And I have a tendency to be more considerate/more respectful towards a dude on the day to day if he’s got that big giant make me cum like crazy dick. It’s just fact. I’ll take more shit from a dude if the dick is good.""
""There’s two different types of girls. Girls that prefer fat and girls that prefer long. I’m more concerned with length than girth. But I have girlfriends that don’t like long dicks or skinny dicks. They’d rather have it short and fat. Basically, penis’s are to women what boobs are to men. Some guys like tiny perky, some guys like big and fake or big and real. Some girls like a lot of length. Some girls would rather have it short and fat. Me, I wanna feel that shit so deep in my vag.. I wanna feel it come out my throat through my asshole.""
""I’ve worked with a lot of big dudes. I don’t really think there is such a thing as a dick being too big. But definitely, I need to be in the right mood to take guys like Mandingo, Lexington Steel, Nacho Vidal, Manuel Ferrara. I think those are the biggest guys I’ve worked with.""

I also said, if you’re small, why don’t you get a huge dildo until she’s satisfied. There’s so many options in this world and most people don’t do the research.

German ex-convict describes his involuntary celibacy in prison.,RageFuel,Iamnothere000,"Jul 24, 2021",25000,119,"So this guy dealt with drugs, guns and “hurt people”, he has spent his twenties in prison and is now married and some kind of social worker.

He talks about the effects of sexual isolation while in prison (tho, masturbation was still possible). The framing of the interview is very emotional and it is obvious that the viewer should feel pity for him because he had such a lonely time.


View: https://youtu.be/_ftEYiTbExY?t=937


Here are some excerpts:

“I don’t know how survived that (time without female contact).”

“I wished I had no sexual desires.”

“Everything triggers you. You see a woman in TV and immediately remember: you can’t have that.”

“I was unable to not reduce the women in prison (social worker) to their sexual aspects. (Because he was so horny)”

“People underestimate what isolation from the other gender does to your head.”

Info text: “Sexual isolation can lead to psychological problems and disturbance of the sexuality in some prisoners.”

“First thing I did (after getting out) was to meet (and fuck) a woman.” (his ex gf, they knew each other since 15 jo, implied they had sex than) His ex gf contacted him after 4 years of imprisonment, asking how she could help him.

“Sex is like riding a bicycle; you don’t forget how to do it.”

“Hugging, without top, skin to skin, was indescribable.”

“How can a women be so soft and smell so good?”

“It was like being 16 again, hard to describe.”

Moderator: „You are talking about things that for others are just natural…“



Keep in mind that this guy had sex since he was 15-16, while he was working on his criminal career. He “just” experienced inceldom for 10 years; he knew when it would end.

Conclusion: Everyone who tells us variations of “sex is not a big deal” needs to die be forced into lifelong celibacy. No exceptions."
"r/IncelTears face reveal: meet AdvocateDoogy, the autist behind the ""Prove the Incel Wrong"" comic series",Soy,PPEcel,"Dec 9, 2021",56000,459,"Talk about foreshadowing, Doogycel.

Meet Adam Paul Dooling.


Well, how do I start? How about the fact that he's almost 34 years old and still lives with his parents in Castleford, England? But let's go back in time and look at Doogycel's early life.

Doogycel graduated from North Springs High School in Atlanta, GA. Unfortunately, he did not fully adjust to life in America. Here's him bragging about not being able to keep a job at Target for even two months:


Eventually, Doogycel moved back to England and spent the next several years working a series of temporary retail jobs. That's pretty fucking funny when you consider his high IQ.


Unlike flipping burgers, it requires a 139 IQ for someone to stack shelves. 


In the meantime, he tried to start a YouTube gaming channel, but it flopped, having gained only 4 subscribers.


You can hear his voice here:


Spoiler: kek




View: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZNyj67kEas




After his YouTube channel flopped, he then spent the next few years on Facebook offering his takes on inceldom and trannies. Unfortunately for him, it seems as if most of the 33 Facebook friends he has did not bother to read any of them.


So he turned to writing about the struggles of being socially awkward.


So Doogycel's latest cope for the past year or so has been Reddit, and for the first time in his life, he's gotten more than half a dozen followers, because only on Reddit can you find enough autists who somehow appreciate Doogycel's comics, half of which consist of him arguing against himself.


Cmon Doogycel! Why deny your true nature as a failed sperg? Stop torturing yourself. You can't escape the blackpill, you know.

Females are Psychopaths – A Socio-Historic Review
​
While this victim of the Jesuits was being executed, I was several times obliged to turn away my face and to stop my ears as I heard his piercing shrieks, half of his body having been torn from him, but the Lambertini and the fat aunt did not budge an inch. Was it because their hearts were hardened? They told me, and I pretended to believe them, that their horror at the wretch’s wickedness prevented them feeling that compassion which his unheard-of torments should have excited.

There is dancing and singing around the corpses, and benches are arranged ""for the ladies,"" delighted to witness the killing of aristocrats... A slaughterer at the Abbaye having complained that the ladies placed at a little distance saw badly, and that only a few of those present had the pleasure of striking the aristocrats, the justice of the observation is admitted, and it is decided that the victims shall be made to pass slowly between two rows of slaughterers, who shall be under the obligation to strike with the back of the sword only so as to prolong the agony.

What pissed me off the most is when I talked about my elder relative who abused me when I was young . I described this fucker as bigger , stronger and taller than me and being a dark triad monster. As I talked about that , I notice this foid’s eyes flint in excitement . It freaked me out for a moment . And this foid started twirling her hair and asking me if there’s more information about him.
- @OutcastedOutcast, describing his experience speaking to a female Psychologist (2023)​

Introduction​
Growing up, I never experienced much warmth from my mother. Any attempt to receive positive attention from her was openly rejected. Sometimes she would hurt me on purpose. As I matured and looked around more, I found myself wondering where the much touted feminine-softness was to be found.

I couldn’t see it anywhere. I have three sisters, none of which ever cared for my little brother, me or other male family members. In fact, looking back at 100 years of family history, I only saw self-serving sluts. Sluts that hurt others, sluts that abandoned and abused children. Sluts that tortured husbands. Sluts that tried to cheat with men. Sluts that cheated on men. If anything, there only seemed to be a kind of bond between female family members in maintaining the ubiquitous sluttery. I remember getting up one night to take a leak, and finding my 50 year old mother sitting on the toilet with her phone, gossiping the most hurtful gossip with my sisters.

My austim and social rejection forced me to dive into historic literature to compensate. And even there, I only found ample evidence for what I was experiencing and not what I was taught: That women are the manipulative, cruel and cold-hearted gender. That men are self-sacrificing to the point of doggishness.
As @lifefuel quotes H. L. Mencken in one of his threads:

""Women are quite without that dog-like fidelity to duty which is one of the shining marks of men. They never summon up a high pride in doing what is inherently disagreeable; they always go to the galleys under protest, and with vows of sabotage""

“Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned” goes the saying, but it does not end there. “No woman as lustful as one engaged or witnessing acts of violence” should be another one, based on what I have read and observed. There is something deeply wrong with women, scarily so. The more I learned, the more frightened I became.
Could it really be? That we men glibly worship and seek to co-habitate with creatures that derive pleasure from causing us suffering? That get sexually aroused by scenes of bloodshed and torture? 

Unfortunately I have never seen evidence to the contrary. In this thread, I will lay out some of my findings over the years and I appeal to the reader to form his own judgments.

As a foundation for my thread I am using the revised Hare Psychopathy Checklist which lists the following Items:

1. Glibness/superficial charm
2. Grandiose sense of self-worth
3. Need for stimulation/proneness to boredom
4. Pathological lying
5. Conning/manipulative
6. Lack of remorse or guilt
7. Shallow affect
8. Callous/lack of empathy
9. Parasitic lifestyle
10. Poor behavioral controls
11. Promiscuous sexual behavioral
12. Early behavior problems
13. Lack of Realistic, long-term goals
14. Impulsivity
15. Irresponsibility
16. Failure to accept responsibility for own actions
17. Many short-term marital relationships
18. Juvenile delinquency
19. Revocation of conditional release
20. Criminal versatility

Already the astute blackpiller will recognize a number of items on this list, if not the majority, that could be attributed to females in their life. Also, most items clearly overlap, such as superficial charm, sexual promiscuity, manipulation. The mere act of a woman manipulating a man with the promise of sex combines multiple psychopathic traits.

For the sake of this thread, I have collapsed some the items into one and created this outline for my thread:

1. Narcissism
(Glibness/superficial charm; Grandiose sense of self-worth; Shallow Affect

2.Manipulation 
(Pathological lying; Parasitic lifestyle; Lack of remorse or guilt; Conning/manipulative)

3. Hypersexuality
(Promiscuous sexual behavioral; Need for stimulation/proneness to boredom; Many short-term marital relationships

4. Sadism
(Callous/lack of empathy; Revocation of conditional release; Criminal versatility)

5. Recklessness
(Poor behavioral controls; Early behavior problems, Lack of Realistic, long-term goals Impulsivity; Irresponsibility; Failure to accept responsibility for own actions; Juvenile delinquency)


My main focus is to highlight the more violent and sexual-sadistic side of women, so some of the more obvious items like narcissism, which is congruent with psychopathy, will be tackled only briefly.
Note: “Revocation of conditional release” means they will not show mercy and give you another chance. They won’t let you go on parole. If they feel hurt, they are relentless and will stalk and pursue you until you die. @Atavistic Autist can contribute something on the psychopathic drive if he wants.
On to the first point:​
1. Narcissism
(Glibness/superficial charm; Grandiose sense of self-worth; Shallow Affect)​“I had all the characteristics of a human being—flesh, blood, skin, hair—but my depersonalization was so intense, had gone so deep, that my normal ability to feel compassion had been eradicated, the victim of a slow, purposeful erasure. I was simply imitating reality, a rough resemblance of a human being, with only a dim corner of my mind functioning” 
- Bret Easton Ellis, “American Psycho”

a) Obsession with Appearance
Try finding pictures of women without makeup on google. Good luck, there aren’t many. Before underinformed midwits respond with pictures of women clearly wearing foundation and other products: Study up on makeup, watch a few make-up tutorials. Even in make-up tutorials, the foids don’t start without already wearing makeup. There is almost no footage of a woman without any make-up.

How is this socially acceptable for women but not men? If a man was just a tiny bit as obsessed with his own appearance as women, he would be called gay or a narcissist.
Further, women are by far the biggest group to get plastic surgery. Many, and I mean many, women you know have gotten plastic surgery. You will not be able to tell mostly.​



“Although it might seem that men are catching up quickly, when it comes to having plastic surgery, this is still a woman’s game by a very large margin. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) reveals from its 2014 plastic surgery statistics that women accounted for 92% of all cosmetic procedures, with the remaining 8% going to men. These demographic trends spell it out in big numbers this way: 13.6 million total cosmetic procedures were performed for women in 2014, while 1.3 million total cosmetic procedures were recorded for men. That means both women and men were seeking plastic surgery as well as non-invasive cosmetic treatments.”​

b) Narcissistic Supply
Women thrive on attention of any kind. They are not people. Please keep this in mind. One of the core features of narcissism is the empty core. Narcissism is a lack of personhood. Narcissists are not people, they are the sum of their sources of attention. That’s why they lash out constantly but can’t take the slightest bit of critique. Their core self is one of extreme insecurity.

That means for one that they are extremely cowardly deep down. And second it means that they depend on other peoples attention, positive or negative to feel like they are alive, like they are real even. Remember, they are not people. Cutting one of their narcissistic supply lines is akin to cutting off one of their limbs, literally. That’s why women loose their mind if their supply dies down.

You can imagine it like a coma-patient hooked up to a multitude of life-supporting hoses. If just one hose is cut, his heart monitor starts screaming. This also makes women sadistic and terrified of boredom. When they are not receiving attention, they feel as if they cease to exist. They deliberately cause others pain to avoid this feeling.
One time my entire family accidentally ignored my mother for maybe two consecutive days. She fell into a deep depression.

If you think about the implications of this, you can also see how narcissism alone leads to many features of psychopathy, like hyper-sexuality, sadism, boredom, lack of empathy etc. Hence, the two conditions are viewed as unavoidably linked by psychologists.

To give two more examples: In the past I noticed that my mother is attracted to strong emotions, including suffering. When I was in my worst state of mind and just wanted to be alone, my mother would not stop pestering me. It was scary. She could not help herself but swarm to me and the pain I was radiating. Not with empathy, I must remark, but with sheer callousness. She did not hug me or listen to me when I said I need to be alone. Instead she kept barging into the room, spouting nonsense, her face weirdly glowing, like she was feeding on my energy.
Suffice to say, I was deeply disturbed.



The user I dedicated this thread to, I @To_Live_is_to_Serve, reports similar behavior in his own mother:​



To keep in my then bedroom and leaving the rest of the house to my mother before I moved away from her wasn't enough for her; she axed her way into my bedroom when I was trying to get some rest and sleep, harassed me there when my energy was low and stole any piece of clothing I was fond of. It did not help that I let her have more than what I claimed for myself; she still tried to take everything I had and break me mentally, the latter in which she was partially successful in. I would not have been able to defend my space even if I knew everything I know know because of all the right women unfortunately have.​

I highly recommend reading some of his threads. He had lots of high IQ takes.

I propose there is also an element of hedonistic adaption at play here: The more stimulus you are exposed to, the more you need in the future to get the same pleasure out of it. For women that means, at some point causing, watching and experiencing pain becomes the only way to feel like they exist.
I recommend watching this video:


View: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz5CX5q2osU


She basically explains how the key to hurting a narcissist is to destroy their social network, so they have no supply and kill themselves or do something stupid.

The criteria I summed up under Narcissism include: Glibness/superficial charm; Grandiose sense of self-worth; Shallow Affect.
We have already gone into superficial charm, which is just looks and maximizing your SMV to get narcissistic supply and feed their unending hunger for attention. Women do everything their power to increase sexual-dimorphism.

Esther Vilar writes in her book “The Manipulated Man”:​



THE MASK OF FEMININITY There is virtually no difference between an unmade-up, bald, naked, woman and an unmade-up, bald, naked man, except their reproductive organs. Any other difference between them is artificially produced. A man becomes a man because he develops his intelligence and, through its development, his productivity. His appearance changes very little. A woman becomes a woman by means of gradual stultification and by deliberately transforming her external appearance, and this differentiation between the sexes is prompted exclusively by woman.​

Click to expand...


The Grandiose sense of self worth is just a cope rooted in deep insecurity. They know they are garbage, they know they are evil, they know they deserve to be punted across the room like a football. Don’t be mistaken on this. Women sometimes even admit this openly. That’s why they loose their mind if you insult them. Like, if you tell a woman she has ugly ears, she will not forget that until she dies. I am not joking.
They are weak and pathetic.

Which gender constantly has to remind each other that they are queens and awesome and you deserve it all etc.


Shallow Affect, many may not be familiar with what this means, but it basically just implies that
“emotions may be felt but in shallow and fleeting ways.” If you’ve ever observed female emotional display in the wild, you will have seen this. They laugh, cry, yodel – whatever. But the moment they feel like nobody is looking, their mask drops and they show zero emotions. They display a lot of shallow emotions very openly, but they are just that: Shallow.

Men feel much deeper but rarely express themselves. When a man cries, his country probably got invaded by the Huns and 13 million people are dead.

A lot of blackpillers don’t get how deep this goes though. Very often when a woman displays emotions, she feels NOTHING. I repeat, she feels nothing. Even in casual settings. You have to learn to spot it, but they really don’t feel that much over all.

And again, I cite Esther Vilar in her own words:​



A woman with feelings would have to think and work, to take on responsibilities, and to learn to do without all the things which mean so much to her. Because she does not want this, she decides to remain callous, but she knows, at the same time, that it is necessary for woman to enact the role of a sensitive being or man would become aware of her essentially cold, calculating nature. ​

Still, as her emotions are always faked and never felt, she can keep a clear head. You can take advantage of someone's feelings only if you are not involved yourself. Therefore, she turns her partner's emotions to her own profit, only taking care to make sure he believes she feels as deeply as he himself, perhaps even more deeply She must make him believe she, `as a woman,' is much less stable, much more irrational, much more emotional. Only thus may her deception remain undetected. But manipulation has, in any case, already taken care of that.​

It’s more like they suck up and feed on the emotions coming from the environment. This is also why changes in a woman's behavior are never found in her internal state. It’s always something external that changed. They look for new sources to feed, like a parasite looking for a host. Always look at her environment to explain changes in behavior.

This also explains why women are responsible for 80% of customer purchases:




https://girlpowermarketing.com/statistics-purchasing-power-women/



If their entire existence is externalized, then the solution to all their problems is external. Hence, they buy a lot of trash to comfort their unending desires.
They are like black holes that stop existing once they run out of things to consume. A lot of women describe their sexual needs in existential terms: “I need to feel myself, I need to feel my body.” Like what? You don’t feel your body except when you’re getting pounded and creamed? What they are actually referring to is the hyper-focused attention they get from the male during sex. It makes them feel like they exist.

That’s why gangbangs are even more arousing. It’s like all these dudes want her, only her. Women are literally machines trying to become living, sentient beings by maintaining a constant feedback loop of attention and sex. But they aren’t sentient and they aren’t beings. They are non-beings. That’s why they can’t exist in the absence of true beings like men. If they try, the fall apart.

As it says in the bible when God punishes Eve: “Your desire shall be for your husband, but he shall rule over you.” Women are trapped in a permanent attempt to actualize and become real beings, but they only tumble toss themselves into self-annihilation.

And further, their excessive social media usage. For any postmaxxers reading this: You have no idea. Women are far far worse rotters and postmaxxers than people on this forum. A lot of women have snapscores in the millions. I have observed women mindlessly browse shopping articles for 90 minutes without break.
This is another theory I want to propose here: Women are in fact driven people, but their drive is not as obvious as in male psychopaths. @Atavistic Autist sometimes talks about the psychopathic drive.

This refers to the following:
Psychopaths are extremely easily bored (they are materialistic, no internal drive, no higher values) and they get four times the dopamine out of succeeding that a normal person does.









Psychopathic Traits Linked to Brain Reward System


People who scored high on a test that measures impulsive and antisocial traits had exaggerated brain responses to certain “rewards,” like winning money or taking stimulant drugs, a new study shows.




www.nih.gov






This means, psychopaths develop what the mainstream now calls “obsessive personalities.” This refers to their obsessive drive to succeed at any cost. A good example would be Mr. Beast, a self proclaimed “obsessive personality.” Other people online have also already remarked on Mr. Beast being potentially psychopathic.
With women I think we see similar drives but they are out of the purview of men, so we are largely blind to them. One example I already cited is their insane social media abuse. To quote myself here: “A womans entire life is a myopic chase of maximizing socio-sexual satisfaction.” Women treat life like a video game, where you min-max your character stats to get as much attention as possible. They are very driven in the pursuit of this.

In a reply on one of @lifefuels threads I also talked about how they even plan their weddings ahead since early childhood and pick betabuxxers to exploit 20 years in advance. They are extremely single-minded and driven in their pursuit of the few things they are interested in, which are mostly sex, attention and material pleasures. And they do not compromise. Women’t don’t accept bad deals. Women don’t grind smash bros for months. Either they have a 100% chance shot at reaching the goal or they give up immediately.

That also means that when they select a male to betabuxx from their thousands of orbiters, they are making a very deliberate choice. They basically set up an obstacle course to find the best victim to exploit. They pick the guy that they know will let them get away with their behavior. It is very evil. If you have a father, he was most likely selected for being a giga simp, I am sorry.

Examples would be:
Jordan Peterson talking about how his wife picked him as a child and said she would marry him.
My father telling me exactly the same story about a girl he used to play with as a toddler.
And MGTOW fathers reporting their young daughters saying things like: “Some men are for fun, some are for marriage.”
The later statement alone is so heinous that it should warrant an ISIS style execution.

I have seen this IRL where girls keep folders of pictures of dresses and wedding rings. They think about who is going to be at the wedding and so forth. They are like five years old when they do this.

As a man, you can not out-maneuver a womans social planning, you are fucked. Stop thinking you can you doofus. Your only advantage as a man is violence but even then, I am not so sure women don’t enjoy being violently assaulted. I say that because another feature of psychopathy is that not feeling anxiety. Even at gunpoint, they only get a kick out of the adrenaline. Their brain does not connect the rush of adrenaline to the fear response most people would have. With women, you sometimes see the same thing. A few years ago there was this online trend where women talked about wanting their BF to put a loaded gun to their head because it turned them on. I am not joking. They enjoy dangerous situations way too much IMO.

And they act reckless when in them. There used to be a video on BestGore where this bitch had an argument on the street with two criminals and they backed down and went to their car. Women don’t understand mercy, they only understand punishment-reward (more on that later). So when the two cartel dudes backed down and went to their car, she felt encouraged to keep arguing. They are that dumb. She ran after the guys and one of them snapped and shot her like 12 times.​
2. Manipulation
(Pathological lying; Parasitic lifestyle; Lack of remorse or guilt; Conning/manipulative)​
This is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats and wipes her mouth, And says, “I have done no wickedness.”​- Proverbs 30:20, NKJV

Some time ago @Gymcelled made this thread:
https://incels.is/threads/womens-br...ological-liars-3-studies-neuroscience.260425/

Like I already wrote, a lot of people don’t understand just how much women lie. A woman will literally post on some feminist subreddit about how women are sexually objectified while doing anal IRL. The chad will watch her post and she will put her phone down and suck his dick. They don’t understand the concept of hard values. To them, virtue signaling is the same as being a good person. I have seen this behavior in real life, where a girl gave a whole speech in class about being inclusive of people with mental health issues, and only 20 minutes later she openly made fun of an autistic man she knew (she even mentioned he had autism). They see nothing wrong with this.

So, anything they say, any values they espouse to have, anything really – You can safely ignore it. Just ignore it, it means nothing. When they tell you a tale of someone being mean to them or something – they are narcissists. They will never admit fault so they are lying.
I want to introduce another metric here: The Kohlberg Morality Test

@Cybersex is our hope made a thread on this long ago:
https://incels.is/threads/kholberg-morality-test-foids-are-children-confirmed.185439/

In summary: Women do not score above toddler level in attempted measurements of moral development. In Practice this means that they respond to punishment and reward. And more importantly, the two interlink: Not being punished becomes equal to being rewarded. Listen to this drunk woman spill the beans. She basically says, if you can get away with something, you would be stupid not do it.​




Your browser is not able to display this video.




They derive pleasure from getting away with playing the villain. I want you to try something on social media: Write a random women something like “I know what you did” and then ignore her or remove her from your contacts. In experiments conducted by me and fellow blackpillers, these women will desperately try to reach out to you, sometimes for months. They keep sending friend requests and such. There is an old saying that goes: “Beat your wife once a week, if you don’t know why, she does.” 

This is true. You can put any woman on the spot simply by implying you know something she has done. They all have done really messed up stuff that they are hiding. All of them.

Another video worth watching and saving:








The Power Fantasy


Originally posted to Youtube - 14th January 2018 The male power fantasy is about being a hero, and saving the day. The female power fantasy is about being a villain, and getting away with it.




www.mgtow.tv





Colltaine observes that movies aimed at primarily female audiences follow a predictable pattern: The female villain arc. The main character, with which the audience identifies mind you, is usually a sexually promiscuous, manipulative female that does all kinds of shenanigans, often times encouraged and supported by other women. Eventually however, all her evil has no impact, she lands the man of her desire and the story concludes. They love being the villain and getting away with it.
Art imitates life gentlemen.

I’ve already cited Esther Vilar as a woman taking a shot at women earlier. Another, less well known one is Michelle Langley. She wrote two very important books called “Women’s infidelity I” and “Womens infidelity II.” As I mentioned before, everything I bring up can be found at the end of thread in a mega.nz file, including these books. In her books, Michelle Langely lays out exactly how women don’t commit to the choices they make and instead prefer to be in what she calls “limbo.” Basically they refuse to admit they are making choices while making them. This also gives them plausible deniability – “I didn’t like him anyway.”

Another thing this gives women is control. When you are not emotionally invested into something, you can destroy and manipulate it at will. Things having labels such as “husband” or “child” does not matter. It’s an object. It’s interesting how this lines up with Vilars quote from earlier, that women only display pretend emotions to manipulate, but feel nothing in reality.

I’ve already explained in my other thread on masculinity being a social construct, how women view men as an out-group. Aka, we are strangers.

https://incels.is/threads/masculinity-is-an-actual-social-construct-and-more-studies.481353/

Langley does not talk about these findings but observes behaviors in women that obviously relate o them. Women do not view men holistically. Men are placed on a linear spectrum that ranges from “money” to “penis.” You either benefit her materially or sexually. If you don’t benefit her, you may as well be dead. Case in Point: Many men report being left by their women the second they fell on hard times. 

Again, this is psychopathy. They view other people in terms of what they can do for them. To a woman, you are not Johnny. You are “the guy who can fix my roof.” Or, “the guy that buys sandwiches.” You are not a person. Like I said, they treat life like a video game, min/maxxing their stats as they go along. “How much penis can I risk while keeping 1100 dudes in orbit and being in a “committed” relationship?” These are the kind of calculations a woman does.

Langley’s books are structured in a sort of socractic dialogue, where she engages in a back and forth with a female. She points out how women will often say they are doing things for the kids or to avoid hurting their husband, but really, they only fear loosing control. They have a control fetish.
I could go on and on, the books are a goldmine.

I have not talked much about specific manipulation methods at this point but a classic one is DARVO – Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender. Anyone who has ever argued with a woman or seen a woman argue with a man has seen this. First they deny guilt, then accuse you of something you did (often completely unrelated), then they start crying and pretend to be the victim (BUHUUU WHY ARE YOU YELLING BUUHUUU).

People should really stop shitting on MGTOW and start reading about these guys hands-on experience with women. It’s a goldmine. You will never want to be in a relationship again and you will clearly see the patterns of manipulation in your own family. Like with your mom and dad for instance.
Things I have observed:

1. They start fights because it’s pleasurable to them. Check point four on sadism for more.
2. A woman always tries to find out what hurts you the most emotionally. Then she will keep that in mind and use it against you at will. They know exactly where to stab you to cause maximum pain.
3. “A relationship with a woman is a cult of two” – This is the literal truth.

Let’s do a side by side comparison between cults and male-female relationships:

1. Cults look for vulnerable targets to exploit – Depressed people, people that struggle in life, people looking for purpose. Lonely people. They then do what is called “love bombing.” This means they shower the victim in unconditional affection and adoration for a while to get them addicted.

Women target men to betabuxx that have been kept in permanent sexual-deprivation their entire life. Then they give them the best sex they’ve ever had and completely disable the mans thinking brain.

Quote my mom: “You (my dad) only came over for that one thing (sex).”
She later said to me and my sister: “I only married your dad because I thought he would be rich.”
During the love-bombing period women also pretend to be interested in you, your hobbies etc. They may even join your religion. Hence, the term “chameleons” originates with MGTOW not incels, since its a phenomenon mostly betabuxxers are subjected to, not men that never get sex anyway.

2. Stage two of the assault is to slowly withdraw affection and start making demands. In cults this usually takes the form of the person having to cut off all contact with family and friends. They also ask you to demonstrate your commitment somehow, by handing over all your money for instance.

Women do this in the exactly the same manner. They begin by withdrawing sexual access and validation. The man, ever the helpful dog, will beg her to tell him what’s wrong. At this point she demands something like marriage, money or something else. They try to draw you into their grasp by baiting you into making gradually bigger commitments, until the final commitment, marriage, is no longer a leap of faith, but a walk of faith.

This psychological trick is also used in marketing:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-in-the-door_technique

What the technique entails is that the step from accepting a small deal to accepting a very big deal is tiny. So when you get someone to make a small commitment, the likelihood of getting them to make a huge one skyrockets.

Example:​



One of my favorite studies demonstrating this involves having people agree to sign a petition that driver safety is important. Then two weeks later, they ask for the larger request. All told, 76% agreed to place a billboard in their yard. Yes, you read that correctly: a BILLBOARD (Freedman & Fraser, 1966). ​

https://opentext.wsu.edu/social-psychology/chapter/module-6-persuasion/

Case in Point: Even my simp dad couldn’t believe when an engineer with a doctorate wifed up my whore sister. When he questioned the guy, he said this: “After eight years it didn’t make much of a difference.” Meaning, after being a betabuxxer for eight years, putting a ring on it didn’t make much of a difference. It’s a huge step to sign a marriage contract. But she had successfully conned him into mentally downplaying what he was about to do.
Usually however, women bait the man into marriage using sex or by getting pregnant on purpose. Then they start making more overt threats. This is where the cultic nature really becomes apparent:

3. Stage Three:
They ask the buxxer to leave his friend group and move to another country or state. I have seen this multiple times in my life.
The man looses all his friends, the woman finally becomes his only supply of validation.
Further, she threatens him by saying he has to be more mature, think of the kids, and so on. A classic manipulation tactic is by making people feel more responsible than they are. It makes the victim feel powerful but really, they are being conned into servitude.

- My Dad lost his entire friend group after my mom made him move
- and the cream de la cream: I had someones mother openly admit to me that she said to her husband, and I quote: “I told him, if he doesn’t leave the military and moves to another state with me, I am divorcing him and taking the kids.”

Michelle Langley talks about how women are not committed to relationships at all. For a woman relationships are emotions. For a man, it is duty. A man will stick to a relationship like a captain going down with the ship. This also means,

a) The woman can cheat on you simply by loosing feelings and having feelings for another man.
b) Women know that men will not leave and abuse this knowledge mercilessly. They know that their buxxer will forgive if they cheat. They know that unlike her, he cares about the children and will stay to be the father, no matter what.

I already laid it out when I mentioned Kohlbergs morality scale and how women think you are weak for letting them manipulate you. She resents the husband for letting her get away with her behavior. From his perspective, he has a duty to stay in this relationship so he doubles down no matter what. Its like two animals locked in combat, neither willing to let go. Somethings got to give and usually the foid pulls the trigger and divorces or cheats.

Again, psychopathy, you can’t win with these creatures.
Another heinous psychopathic behavior we already tackled under the label of “Revocation of conditional release” shall be briefly examined here. The term means simply that they don’t let you go. There’s no probation when you hurt a woman. There’s no mercy. They want you dead and their resentment lasts a lifetime.

Comedian Patrice O’Neal occasionally talked about this and said, women will not leave you before they have destroyed you. This is very very true. I have already explained that women always try to do maximum emotional damage. For their pleasure and to hurt you, depends, really they enjoy it both ways. This includes figuring out what things you care about and then destroying or damaging them.

For instance, they kill your pets. Or your car. Or they try to get the dog in the divorce settlement and then have it put down. My mom deliberately crashed multiple of my dads favorite vehicles to hurt him. Another case from MGTOW circles, this guy had a pet tarantula for 10 years, was really attached to it. Finally found a girl, she took it while he was gone and stomped on it and threw it in the trash.

Terrence Pop on youtube, decorated war veteran of the Gulf War. Recorded his wife cheating by bugging her phone. Court dismissed it and threatened him with additional charges for exposing his wifes cheating. Then she got the dog in the divorce and killed it.

IRL I knew someone who’s aunt said her long-term boyfriend “suddenly went mad and dumped all her shit outside her workplace.” Some digging revealed that “he was mad because his stupid parrot died.” No comment.

Another thing Michelle Langley talks about is that women would rather have their partner die in an accident, than to break up with them openly. Because breaking up is a pro-active, negative behavior and women always have to maintain the women-are-wonderful facade. That’s why they slander the man after breaking up with him and even before. They need plausible deniability, so they tell everyone how he is abusive and psycho and so on.

One of the more terrifying realizations about my mom’s first marriage is that she potentially attempted to kill her first husband by having him beat up. She says of him that he was poor and she didn’t want to stay anyway. They had two kids already. The story goes that he worked in a bar and tried to break up a fight but was knocked out. Then they stomped on his neck. He was in a coma. My mother recounts:

“I got the call and went to the hospital. When I saw him hooked up to all the hoses I thought, he’s going to die anyway.” So she divorced him right there. He made a full recovery and never paid child support, which is also odd. Maybe he’s not the father of my step sisters either.
I can’t imagine what’s really going on there, but people have said I look nothing like my biological siblings either. Fuck women.

To go back to “Revocation of conditional release,” many men also report their ex-wives stalking them. Stalking is another female projection, we now have studies that show that women stalk more than men.








Women Are More Likely To Perpetrate Cyberstalking - MisandryToday


Cyberstalking refers to following or harassing a person using electronic means (e.g., using a fake Instagram account to check up on someone). There are three types of intimate partner cyberstalking: passive, invasive, and duplicitous. The passive form is most common. Women are more likely than...




misandrytoday.com





Like I said, everything they say is a lie or projection. Same for rape, only this year I saw someone post studies here showing women rape more than men also, they watch rape porn at disproportional rate, I linked that below.

So, men report their ex-wives stalking them. Revocation of conditional release means that they will forever be resentful of their ex. Additionally, many women do worse after divorce than before. This goes into my last point, “recklessness” – psychopaths lack empathy even for their future self, meaning, they are terrible at considering future consequences for their behavior. Another highly recommended video where it is mentioned how women do worse financially after divorce:
https://www.mgtow.tv/watch/communism-for-two_kgrPi3xKyou1W5H.html

This is why they try to destroy you after you leave them. They are never responsible (narcissism), then they do worse and blame you. And because they can’t let go (revocation of C.L), they try to destroy you. Often times men report their ex wives stalking them on social media and then attacking them with false rape accusations years later. Or trying to hurt the kids on purpose to hurt him. Or setting up a meeting with the kids and then calling the police and having them arrest the father. Everyone here has seen video footage of that.

So much of what women say is projection. Even the much memed “take a shower” accusation has turned out to be a mere projection.
Majority of UK women don't bathe or take a shower daily
https://www.independent.co.uk/life-...f-uk-women-don-t-bath-or-shower-10065854.html

The same goes for rape-propaganda and the much touted insatiable male sex drive. We never hear men say this of themselves. And pornhub released user statistics that clearly demonstrate that

a) women DO watch porn, many on a weekly basis
b) a truckload of it is rough porn, BDSM and rapeplay

Women are just as aroused by pornography as men, largest study of its kind shows


Myth: busted.




www.zmescience.com





Historically speaking, actual rape is exceedingly rare. How many of us could even get an erection from seeing a woman crying? Especially since studies have shown that female tears lower testosterone:








Women's Tears Reduce Sex Drive in Men, Study Hints


Read it, but try not to weep, ladies—your tears may lower your man's sex drive, according to a new study.




www.nationalgeographic.com





In this interesting blog post from 2011, the writer cites a now defunct website that lists the executions in an english town over a 700 year period, alongside the crimes. As it turns out, rape is exceedingly rare and if it happens at all, it usually happens in conjunction with far more violent crimes. What isn’t so rare at all is women killing their babies and getting promptly send to their maker by the medieval justice system.








Wimminz morality, or lack of.


There is an excellent post over at the False Rape Society discussing the almost ignored subject of demographic profiling of actual rapists, as opposed to the wimminz screeching that all men are rap…

https://web.archive.org/web/20110809124902/http://www.exetermemories.co.uk/em/executed.php

I will write more about women killing children under point four, “sadism.” Stick around.
At this point it should be obvious a lot of psychopathic traits naturally evolve from narcissism. Women don’t commit to anything. And being manipulative gives them pleasure, as I just laid out. They are not even there, making choices. You are not talking to person. It’s like the American Psycho quote,

“...there is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me, only an entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable: I simply am not there.”

Just like Patrick Bateman, who is so narcissistic that he becomes the hapless sum of his pop-culture environment, women loose their self in an endless stream of externalities, until they finally surrender their personhood and are “simply not there.” Just automatons, spouting slogans, “fitting in,” and causing massive suffering all round them to feel like they exist. Women walk the earth creating storms, hoping to get hit by lightning.

I feel reminded of the Michael Ende novel, “The Never Ending Story.” Most people only know the kitsch movies. However, the novel has deep esoteric themes. One of the main storylines is that of loss of self through constant self-gratification. The main character is placed in a world where he is God. Any wish he makes is instantly granted. However, in return he looses a memory for each wish. Eventually, he is burned out, barely remembers himself. 

At the end of their own fantasy journey through la-la land, women end up in a similar position. They are burned out, can’t even feel pleasure anymore. In order to feel alive at this point, they resort to extreme violence in the bedroom or outright disgusting acts like animal sex. Most can barely feel any pleasure at all anymore. There is nothing to envy about them at this point. Miserable creatures they are, and miserable they shall be, forevermore.​3. Hypersexuality
(Promiscuous sexual behavioral; Need for stimulation/proneness to boredom; Many short-term marital relationships)​
I’m going to blow some minds now: Women are sexual creatures. Yeah I know, stunning right. Not so stunning is the fact that you still see retards in our circles propagate the myth of the low female sex drive, often citing self-reported studies to boot. I am past the point where I want to curb stomp people like this, so I will just lay out why this can not be true. In fact, let us start with an internal critique and let you, the reader, be the judge:
I claim that even if their sex drive was lower than mens, they would have much more sex.

Let’s replace sex with bread to illustrate:
A man’s hunger for bread is 80%. But he doesn’t really care about baking, bakers, the baking process that much. A man does not define himself by his hunger for bread. Further, his access to bread is severely restricted. Most men of his standing actually have to bribe bakers to even get bread. Additionally, the man is interested in many things besides bread, like engineering, history, video games. Maybe he just likes to sit on his ass and daydream about playing in the NFL, like Patrice O’Neal said long ago.

Let’s assume a woman’s hunger for bread is only 40%. But all she cares about is baking, making bread, bakers, grain. She defines herself by her interest in bread. Everything is bread. Further, bakers literally throw bread at her in public. They scream TAKE MY BREAD LADY, LOOK, DELICIOUS BREAD. Additionally, the woman has no interest whatsoever in anything outside bread. Anything non-bread-related she does ultimately is underpinned by her wish for more bread.

Which gender will eat more bread at the end of the day? The gender that doesn’t even have access to bread, or the gender that literally has people throwing bread at them in public, every single day of their life? And recall, I am granting my opposition their presupposition here, that women have a lower sex drive than men. This also implies women don’t have sex for love and intimacy, but just for pleasures sake. When they get bored, they don’t think about playing a match in StarCraft II. They think about sex. Real sex is the female equivalent of male masturbation. And they get bored a lot, which is a trait of psychopathy. Also, they may even get the 4x higher dopamine from sex, bitches be screaming yo.

Also, “serial monogamy” (lmao) is the most popular form of relationship these days. Aka, being in a short, faux-monogamous relationships (the term monogamy becomes void once you’ve had more than one partner, but let retards dream).

Suffice to say, they have every motivation to cheat and be sexual at their leisure.
Additionally we now have studies from Porn sites that show that women watch porn frequently, a lot on a weekly basis. Who constantly screams about rape again? Men or women? Who constantly says men only care about sex? Which gender? I don’t hear men say that about men.

Another thing. In the below study, they didn’t let people self-report. Instead they measured genital arousal, which is much more reliable, to establish what people were sexually attracted to. The way they did it was like this: They made participants report their sexual orientation: Heterosexual, Homosexual, Bisexual. Then they showed them arousing pictures of homosexuality, heterosexuality, lesbianism and even animals.

The results were stunning. The men reported truthfully, i.e. If they said they were gay, only gay images aroused them. The women on the other hand were aroused by everything. Even animals.​



""The women in the study, on the other hand, didn't react as predictably. While they reported feeling aroused in the ways you might expect (straight women were turned on by men, lesbians by women), measurements of their vaginal blood flow showed that they were physically aroused by all the forms of coupling they saw — even the bonobos.”​

The study concludes in a really funny quote by one of the female researchers:​



""There's the possibility that genital response for women is not necessarily imbued with meaning about her sexual interests,"" says Chivers. She also emphasized that her findings do not imply women harbor a latent desire for lesbian sex or bestiality."" ​

[monkeywire] Study: Human women aroused by bonobo sex



So far we have established:
a) Women have a much higher incentive to be sexual than men, even if their sex drive is low.
b) Women are aroused by everything that moves
c) Women are not capable of monogamy

I rest my case.​
4. Sadism
(Callous/lack of empathy; Revocation of conditional release; Criminal versatility)​Oh boy, one of my favorites. The reason I made this thread:
I already cited Casanova and Le Bon at the beginning of this thread. I’ve also given examples of why and how women deliberately cause other people pain to achieve their desired ends. I’ve also quoted @OutcastedOutcast and his experience with a female psychologist that got a rise out of listening to his tale of being abused by a bigger male.

Of course this lines up perfectly with what I have recounted, about my mother feeding off my suffering, as well as what I cited from dead user @I_only_serve_now and his mother. It obviously lines up because women as a whole display psychopathic traits, one of which is sadism.

I think it is safe to say that sadism is like the opposite of empathy. Not only does it describe a lack of empathy but rather the enjoyment of the pain of others. I will lead you into this bit by bit, starting with this little article here, titled “Women gain happiness from seeing their partner upset - because it 'shows their relationship is strong.'”








Women gain happiness from seeing their partner upset - because it 'shows their relationship is strong'


Psychologists believe that women gain happiness from seeing their partners unhappy as being able to spot their other halves' bad moods shows the strength of their relationship.




www.dailymail.co.uk





The study was based on brainwave monitoring.​



“Lead researcher Shiri Cohen of Harvard Medical School explained why women's brains showed a positive reaction to seeing their husband or partner upset. She said: 'It could be that for women, seeing that their male partner is upset reflects some degree of the man's investment and emotional engagement in the relationship, even during difficult times.”​

And another interesting video, please pay attention to the wifes facial expressions while watching her husband go through excruciating pain:

View: https://youtu.be/lgrz-QBrqqc


Relevant timestamps: At 1:45 she is still bored. By 4:40 she's getting wet. At 5:30 she is smiling a big smile.

Like with the animal-arousal study I cited earlier, the findings are deliberately downplayed or misinterpreted. Women take pleasure in torturing their men = They actually love them. What a joke. How would they react if we said, being raped is actually a sign men find you attractive, you should be glad you got raped.
I have included the study in the mega.nz. Fellowcels that want to read and stay informed, download all information at your leisure from sci-hub or libgen and safe, safe, safe all you got. In my time online, I’ve found that sometimes studies don’t get published that contain critical info. For instance, there was one study where they found that parents didn’t care if their sons died. The researcher was a weirdo who spent years testing trolley safety for super markets, the finding was coincidental. It was never released.

Now I would like to introduce you to something else: The Milgram Experiment.
The Milgram experiment tells us something about normies. But when the ABC Channel repeated the experiment a few years ago, it also pointed to something interesting about women, can you guess what?

The experiment is conducted as follows:
An actor pretends to be electrocuted by screaming while participants turn a dial to control how much shock he receives. Most people turn the dial a little bit, hear him scream and stop. The research assistant standing next to them then says: “The experiment requires that you continue.” Over 70% of the people involved promptly turn the shock up to a lethal dose. In the ABC Channel’s recreation of the experiment, it turned out that women were more likely than men to electrocute a man to death. Shocker, forgive my pun, but in the light of what I’ve laid out so far, is this surprising in the least?

Interesting comments:

Further, in other repeats of the study where they replaced the actor with an actress, people refused to shock her to a higher degree.

Historic sources also talk about how native americans would hand prisoners over to their women to be tortured. And Otto Weininger suggests in “Sex and Character” that women work in nursing because they remain unaffected by the suffering they are witnessing:​



It is short-sighted to regard women’s nursing as a proof of their compassion, because it indicates the precise opposite. A man would never be able to watch the torments of the sick. He would be so worn down by suffering with them that he would be totally unable to care for them. If one observes female nurses one is astonished to see how calm and “gentle” they remain, even when faced with the most terrible spasms of the dying, and this is just as well, because men, who cannot stand pain and death, would make bad nurses. A man would want to alleviate the agony, delay death, in a word, help. Where no help is possible he has no place: that is where nursing comes into its own, and for nursing only women are suitable​

Nursing constantly involves “benevolent torture.” The routine act of shoving a catheter up a mans urethra alone is extremely painful. The stereotype of the slutty, hypersexual nurse is also rooted in reality. I will explain this using Lindy effect in my epilogue. Also, I now want to introduce the legend of Shrek6:
Shrek6 is a man in his 60s from Australia who was married twice, has multiple kids and posts on avoiceformen.com. He gives us this interesting historical tidbit:





Note how the women are used to find new victims because people trust women more and aren’t suspicious of single women. Female evil is often overlooked because they unfold it under the authority of a male. The male then gets blamed. @Idotms is an expert on the study of cults and can confirm that often times the cult leaders most psychopathic and sadistic helpers are the women closest to him. They supply him with victims and participate in the torture.
There are many such ways in which women hide their evil under the auspices of authority.​
On Criminal versatility:
For women this so called versatility is mostly rooted in them being female and neotenous. A reddit thread from the Mens Rights Subreddit sheds light on the issue:

View: https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/xyl5wb/statistics_cited_women_are_more_likely_to_commit/


Of special note is this reply:

To sum it up: The poster recounts working as a store detective and being instructed to have confirmation bias for ethnic minorities when making arrests. However, the FBI statistics they were trained on showed that the most common shoplifter was “a 22 year old white woman with at least two years of college.”

Late 1800s psychologist Gustave Les Bons also tells of gynocentric bias in the court system:​



Like all crowds, juries are very strongly impressed by senti mental considerations, and very slightly by argument. ""They cannot resist the sight,"" writes a barrister, ""of a mother giving its child the breast, or of orphans."" ""It is sufficient that a woman should be of agreeable appearance,"" says M. des Glajeux, ""to win the benevolence of the jury."" 

Without pity for crimes of which it appears possible they might themselves be the victims—such crimes, moreover, are the most dangerous for society—juries, on the contrary, are very indulgent in the case of breaches of the law whose motive is passion. 

They are rarely severe on infanticide by girl-mothers, or hard on the young woman who throws vitriol at the man who has seduced and deserted her, for the reason that they feel instinctively that society runs but slight danger from such crimes, and that in a country in which the law does not protect deserted girls the crime of the girl who avenges herself is rather useful than harmful, inasmuch as it frightens seducers in advance.​

Again, this issue of female criminality follows the same logic as the sex-drive question.
If they solely respond to punishment and reward, if they are the majority of customers and only interested in material things… if they can get away with it...and if they feel rewarded for getting away with a crime since they are not capable of abstract guilt…
I rest my case.

Another thing I would like to tackle is the murder and abuse of children at the hands of women. Again, this is counter intuitive for most normies because they were raised by women who indoctrinated them with women-are-wonderful effect. But for me, who’s mom was not present, cold and abusive, I was spared such biases.
The historic record is very clear: Women fucking hate children XD. Like, holy fuck, do they ever harbor a hatred of children. When studying this topic, you better brace for blackpill impact. The wikipedia articles on infanticide and the history of abortion alone read like a long version the “total nigger death” copypasta, only that it’s real and it’s women killing babies.

Killing babies by roasting them in the sun, Killing babies by stepping on their neck (japan). Killing babies by headshotting them with sewing needles after birth. Killing babies by burning them in ovens. Killing babies by staving them to death. Killing babies by throwing them in rivers. Killing babies by throwing them on dungheaps. The list goes on and on. These are not isolated incidences gentlemen, these are historic trends that were so prevalent that contemporary historians remarked on them each time. You would think that abortions were rare before modern medicine but you are wrong. They had their methods and women don’t give a fuck, simply put. They would have a train run over their pregnant gut if it got rid of the little tyke standing between them and their pleasure.

Basically, before modern abortion, women formed entire businesses around covertly killing their offspring. You would hand your baby to a “baby farm” under the pretense of foster care, and they would kill it for you. This is reminiscent of when the christian church tried to reduce infanticide by granting women the option of anonymously handing their newborns over to monasteries. They didn’t realize they were dealing with total ingrates. Soon after, monasteries and related nurseries were overflowing with even more babies. The situation was horrible. To this day they find mass graves of dead babies around monasteries.









Nuns in Ireland buried babies and children in mass grave


Survivors of Irish mother and baby homes say the shocking discovery is ""the tip of the iceberg.""




www.thenationalnews.com





I think people underestimate the amount of baby murder in the past. Yes, we now have 60 million abortions a year, but when looking up some statistics from the victorian era, it’s not that different:​



[5] It is estimated that the abortion rate jumped from one abortion in every 25-35 live births during 1800-1830 to one in every 5-6 live births by 1850. These figures may be a bit high (evidence is still sketchy), but are indicative of a trend. — Timothy Crumrin​

What Abortion Was Like in the 19th Century


To be unmarried and pregnant meant deep trouble.

Another thing I have become doubtful off is the sky-high child mortality rate people had back in the day. My suspicions were further corroborated when was reading up on witch hunts and came across one of the most famous medieval documents on witch hunts: The “Hammer of Witches.” The document is shit and for good reason. It was written to save someones ass in a hurry. But that does not mean we can not derive value from it. It's basically is a laughable collection of folklore, local jokes about witchcraft and real documented court cases of child murder. These later ones are what caught my attention and I cite:​



... (that in various ways midwife sorceresses kill the fetuses in the womb and cause miscarriages, and when they do not do this, they offer the new-borns to demons​
Another midwife (this one in the diocese of Strasburg) confessed that she had killed countless children (there was no agreement as to the number). She was caught in the following way. She had been summoned from one town to another to serve some woman as midwife, and at the end of the job, she wished to return home. As she passed out through the town gate, by chance the arm of a newborn child fell to the ground from the linen cloth in which she was wrapped and in which the arm had been rolled up. This was seen by people sitting within the gateway, and after she passed, they lifted what they thought to be a piece of meat from the ground and looked at it quite carefully.​
After they realized by the joints that it was not a piece of meat but the arm of a child, they had a meeting with the chief magistrates. When it was discovered that a baby had died before baptism and was lacking an arm, the sorceress was arrested. Exposed to questioning under torture, she revealed the crime. In this way, as has already been said, she confessed that she had killed babies without number.

Furthermore, as was made clear in part one of the work f rom the confession of the serving girl who was induced to repent in Breisach, greater losses are inflicted on the Faith by midwives in connection with this Heresy of Sorceresses, and this has also been proven by the confession of certain others who were later burned to ashes. In the town of Thann in the diocese of Basel one midwife who was burned to ashes confessed to having killed more than forty children by the following method. When they emerged from the womb, she would stick a pin into their heads through the crown straight down into the brain.​

This method of pushing a large needle through the babies still soft skull after birth, often done by the midwife in agreement with the mother, still lingered until the 19th century. On the unknownmisandry.blogspot.com website I linked earlier for instance, we find this cited under the list of murder methods employed by the women convicted: Needle into heart° – Makin (needle, heart), Mittlestedt (darning needle, heart)

I can only recommend reading the links I provided, very interesting. This thread is too long already but as I said, the fiery pit is endless and female abandon knows no limits. Let’s look at a statistic to finalize this point:

71% of Children Killed by One Parent are Killed by Their Mothers; 60% of Victims are Boys
http://www.breakingthescience.org/SimplifiedDataFromDHHS.php

Additional studies can easily procured from sites like this:


http://www.mrarchivist.com/data/



We have plenty of finding at this point that show that women are just as violent as men and that the majority of child sexual abuse is committed by women. Even when it comes to sexual assault, women get the highscore.​



In studies with college-aged samples, between 18.2% (Russell & Oswald, 2001) and 49.5% of women reported using some form of sexual coercion to obtain sexual contact (e.g., kissing, petting, and forced intercourse; Carvalho & Nobre, 2015; Schatzel-Murphy et al., 2009; Struckman-Johnson et al., 2003).​

Another one everyone here already knows is hybristophilia, female attraction to violence:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybristophilia

Another way women try to release their innate desire for gore is by consuming medical dramas to a high degree. Author Lawrence Shannon talks of this in his book “the predatory female” which was published in the 1980s:​



Q What is the doctor's role in the life of the predatory female? 

A. Doctors are a big part of the predatory female's security. Consequently, predatory females are very doctor oriented and engage in a continuous form of doctor worship. A trait of predatory females is that they perpetually ""seek to the physicians."" This trait is encouraged by the matriarchal system which is the foundation of the doctor cult. The system encourages a constant barrage of doctor-idol TV serials and soap operas​

He goes in depth of how women have this odd sexual relationship with their gynecologist, who in essence is a high status figure that gets to fingerbang them on a regular basis. The book is a very light read, I can recommended it to everyone. You can read it in a few hours.

Maybe all of this obsession with medical shit, doctors etc. is rooted in them bleeding once a month, who knows. Also, all the romance novels women consume are full of rape, violence, gore, just think about 50 shades of grey. One time I read one of my step sisters thriller novels and it was just horrible. It was like a spinning wheel of graphic violence, graphic sex, chad abusing subhumans, rinse repeat.

I have also read quora posts of women admitting being turned on by violence on TV, like scenes of bullying. I experienced this IRL when a tallfag bully beat me up in gradeschool and multiple girls were standing right next to him, encouraging him and saying hit him harder and shit. Lest anyone scoff at this, he gave me a concussion another time which was confirmed by a local doctor. In russian videos where girls bully boys, we also often see older boy standing in the background, covering for the girls as they do their torturing. I have already described this and pointed to @Idotms as an expert on the study of cults and how women try to hide under authority to cover their crimes.

One more anecdote from my wagie days: One day my boss told the staff how he and his wife went to a talk by a child psychologist recently. The psychologist asked the audience which gender they thought had the worse child bullies. The consensus was male but he admonished them. Little girls, he explained, are fare more advanced in their bullying than boys. He said even very young girls meet up before school, discuss who they will bully that day and how.

Ironically I got to see exactly this behavior just a few months after, when a group of office whores bullied a giga manlet truecel and eventually got him fired. It was a group effort and I was privy to their planning as they were chatting about it in the office.
I think we have done enough at this point to establish that women love to hurt other people for pleasures sake.
​5. Recklessness
(Poor behavioral controls; Early behavior problems, Lack of Realistic, long-term goals Impulsivity; Irresponsibility; Failure to accept responsibility for own actions; Juvenile delinquency)​
We just talked about how even little girls engage in extremely calculated bullying of other kids. As we all know, women get away with more stuff than men their entire life. Various MRA outlets have documented, how it used to be permissible for teachers to beat boy students, but not girl students for instance. So it stands to reason that women have a higher chance of showing early behavior problems and getting away with it.

I want to shine light on another often overlooked aspect of psychopathy: Self Destruction.
Most people think of psychopaths as successful people, in the sense of financially successful. This is hogwash. First off, dark triad traits can become a disadvantage if you are too ugly, study below:​



Aggression was associated with a reduction in popularity for adolescents low on facial attractiveness. However, popularity did not decrease as a function of aggression for adolescents high on facial attractiveness. ​

Another problem that comes with the lack of empathy characteristic of psychopathy is a lack of empathy for the future self. This means psychopaths often take risks without considering future implications. This can lead to drug-abuse, alcoholism and in the moment reckless decision like jumping from your roof and doing a backflip into a leaf pile.

We see this behavior in women, who destroy perfectly fine marriages only to be financially worse off later. Or have reckless unprotected sex and then act like they had no choice but to drive 300 miles and fuck chad for nine hours. They don’t think of themselves as being in control, they think shit just happens, yet they claim rights lmao.
You can put a woman in a perfect situation, perfect life, and they will still find a way to be miserable and destroy it. Contrary to many incels belief, women are not happy, despite enjoying the most luxurious lifestyles in human history. This creature can not be happy.

Another outbirth of innate lack of empathy for your future self is their enjoyment of dangerous men, who end up murdering them or being otherwise dangerous. I guess this could be put under the category of “early behavior problems.” One of my stepsisters had a horrible, drug fueled orgy of a teen life and yet ended up betabuxxing a doctor and having two children. All she did was to move 500km to escape the warzone she created. This by the way, is another psychopath trait, frequent moving after people catch on to you. There’s a reason why women like to outsource their fuckery by traveling a lot. Nobody knows what you did in a french hotel room with six chads. And for women, if nobody knows, its morally ok. If they can get away with something, they feel rewarded.

A relevant reddit thread:
“No-one regrets their ""baddie days"" once they get older”

A lot of women have very horrible pasts like that, you can’t tell outwardly really.
Like the shit they do in their youth is mindblowningly fucked up. Only to settle later and live perfectly normal lifestyle, not because of merit, but because the system saves them from themselves. We have seen what happens when these safety mechanisms are eliminated. Like in that survival-show from a few years ago where the female group walked in circles until they almost perished from dehydration after succumbing to constant infighting and bickering. The crew had to intervene to help them.

To sum up this entire thread: There is overwhelming evidence that women as a group demonstrate psychopathic traits. If any men even remotely behaved like the average woman, he would be incarcerated in no time.​


Epilogue
What must be Done


View: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPvy7PNByUY​

“The Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford” is a movie about a man being set up to fail. His juvenile search for glory ends up earning him nothing but scorn and finally death. The villain mass murderer is glorified and becomes a national idol. His killer becomes a social pariah. Eventually some retarded normie trying to virtue signal guns him down in public. Then NPCs vote to get the normie out of prison. It’s a slow and sad movie.​




Your browser is not able to display this video.




Similarly, many men have tried to take down the female idol in history but earned nothing but hatred. The female idol only emerges from the fire unscathed and within one generation everything has blown over. But strewn throughout culture remain seeds that lead people like us to rediscovering the work of these men.
These seeds are part of what is called the Lindy effect.​



Thus, the Lindy effect proposes the longer a period something has survived to exist or be used in the present, the longer its remaining life expectancy. Longevity implies a resistance to change, obsolescence or competition and greater odds of continued existence into the future.[2]​

The idea is simple. Things that are true stick around. If something is true, it does not automatically invalidate itself over time in contact with reality. If somehow everyone were to think chinese people have big noses, that belief would not last for 100 years because it would invalidate itself upon contact with chinese people or images of chinese people.

The fact that the things we talk about have been observed since the beginning of recorded history lends credence to their validity. In our modern times, we can see this very nicely. When the media stopped covering covid for a few days, everyone forgot about it immediately and stopped caring. There was simply no IRL evidence of it existing, so the belief in covid died. Jaques Ellul writes in his book “Propaganda - The formation of Mens Attitudes” about this phenomenon and the need for constant reinforcement of propaganda:​



A good example is Khrushchev’s ultimatum at the beginning of 1959, when he set a time limit of three months to solve the Berlin problem. Two weeks passed; no war broke out. Even though the same problem remained, public opinion grew accustomed to it and lost interest—so much so, that on the expiration date of Khrushchev’s ultimatum (27 May 1959), people were surprised when they were reminded of it. ​

When talking about things like female cruelty or promiscuity, they seem to be permanently embedded in the zeitgeist of Humanity. Throughout the ages, everyone and their mom remarked on how women are callous, unforgiving and hyper-sexual. The idea that women are less sexual than men is not what people believed through most of human history. It’s just an outgrowth of our time. Take the ancient greek tale of Tiresias turning into a woman. After he turns back into a man Tiresias is asked which gender enjoys sex more and replies: ""Of ten parts a man enjoys one only.""​
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiresias








The Myth of Tiresias and the Ten Pleasures of Sex


. Tiresias was a blind prophet of Thebes who told the truth about the past, present and future, although those for whom he prophesied rare...




masculineprinciple.blogspot.com





As everyone reading this knows, we see all female behaviors clearly on display in historic sources. In the Genesis 39, first book of the bible, Potiphars wife tries to cheat on her husband with Joseph, who is described as handsome. When he denies her, she accuses him of rape and her cuck husband has him thrown in prison. Or take the tale of Lots wife, who longingly looks back at the degenerate shitholes of Sodom and Gomorrah and turns to salt as punishment.

Back to the Lindy effect. Natural stereotypes that are not reinforced by the Golem of modern media are true because they are reinforced by reality.
When people observe women being cruel, manipulative and backstabbing, then this stereotype is reinforced and eventually enters the cultural zeitgeist forever. Its like releasing a bunch of animals into the wild and seeing which ones survive. The ones that are the most fit and adapted to the current environment will make it. Its the same with beliefs. Everytime a woman is cruel and psychopathic, her victims will begin looking for exactly these traits in other women. If they see them confirmed, the belief solidifies. Hence we have a millenia long trend of people calling women manipulative, callous, resentful, vengeful, cruel and highly promiscous.

What can be done? Nothing. Unfortunately the Lindy effect also reveals to us that there has never been a solution, or we would already be privy to it. We are at the mercy of our captors. They control the vast majority of the spending, they control the majority of men, and the jew mob running the asylum knows this too. Once you digest all of this, the world has nothing to offer. They can’t offer me anything I want, there is not even anything I want. I just want to stop existing and get the fuck out of this place already. As always,​
It’s over.

Comparison:


It's actually pretty interesting to compare the general demographics of incels with real life (((diverse))) and (((multicultural) centres of the world to see the difference. For example, some ethnic makeup of the literal Indian colony of London:

White: 53.8%

Black: 13.5%

South Asian: 10.8%

Chinese: 1.7% (assuming overall rice percentage is around 3%)

Arab: 1.6% (assuming total sandnigger percentage is around 2%)

White and Asian: 1.4% (assuming total hapa percentage is is lower than that but not by too much, probably around 0.9%. Interesting when you consider the fact that around 2% of the forum is hapa)

Mulatto: 2.4%

Das rite, an incel forum is more diverse and contains a higher percentage of ethnics then the city quite literally known for the amount of niggers and shitskins taking it over. 

Not even going to mention the amount of white liberal woketard faggot Ivy League universities (that create endless research papers on le angry straight white incels) that aren't even fucking close to this forum's level of diversity, you can search those demographics up easily. 

Anyways that was basically the point of making these lists, curiosity and boredom. Maybe some of you can analyze this information and come up with something better out of it."
The incel homicide rate is actually really low (I put a lot of effort in this so everyone GIH),Serious,YuiIsMyCope,"Dec 7, 2022",6000,51,"(Remaking this thread because mods deleted it)

So the incel killings wikipedia lists are ER (6 killed), Umpqua (9 killed), Edmonton (1 killed), Aztec (2 killed), Parkland (17 killed), Toronto (11 killed), Tallahassee (2 killed), Hanau (10 killed), Toronto again (1 killed), and Plymouth (5 killed).

Now the media and anti-incels usually say that lonely, frustrated men are not incels unless they actually identify with the word. Applying that logic here would remove most of this list. The Umpqua shooter never called himself an incel. The closest he got was when he was asked online if he was ""saving himself for someone special"" and said ""involuntarily so"". The Plymouth shooter explicitly said ""I wouldn't clarify myself as an incel"". However, just to prove a point, I'm going to be intentionally unfair to us and include them.

The Aztec and Parkland shooters, however, could not be called incel by even the biggest stretch; they're only included on wikipedia because they idolised mass killers including Elliot Rodger (and so did the Umpqua one). But they obviously just liked him as a mass killer and didn't care about him as an incel. Both were motivate by the alt-right. And the Hanau shooter doesn't seem to have even known about incels. He was motivated by schizophrenia and the alt-right. So I will include them in one calculation and exclude them in another.

Now I need the incel population. r/incels had about 40,000 members when it was banned, and I will assume the number of non-incels and alts subbed to it balances out the number of incels not subbed to it. So I'm just gonna take it as the incel population. Keep in mind that it's the number of people specifically in the incel community and not just the number of involuntary celibates, meaning that most of these shooters aren't even in that number, but once again I'm being unfair to us to prove a point.

So the number of claimed incel homicides is 6+9+1+2+17+11+2+10+1+5=64. And these shootings happened over 8 years. So the homicide rate of incels is (64 x 100,000)/(8 x 40,000) = 20 victims per 100,000 incels per year. According to this and this, that is less than 23 countries and 12 of the most populous 100 US cities (St. Louis, Baltimore, Detroit, New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Kansas City, Cleveland, Memphis, Newark, Cincinnati, Mobile, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Stockton and Tulsa).

The number of actual incel homicides (so not including Aztec, Parkland and Hanau) is 6+9+1+11+2+1+5=35, making the homicide rate (35 x 100,000)/(8 x 40,000) = 10.9 victims per 100k incels per year. That is less than 37 countries, 4 US states/territories and 39 (i.e. over a third) of the 100 most populous US cities.

Another thing to point out is that most homicides are committed by young men; the same demographic that almost all incels are in. I'm sure if you took the crime rates if just the young men in any city, state or country, they would be much higher than the incel one.

So, TLDR, the incel homicide rate is unsurprisingly on the high side but not an outlier when compared with other people's crime rates. And that's when being unfair to us. Since this obviously would not the case for any terrorist or hate group, this proves anything the media says about incels being terrorists or a hate group is just fearmongering clickbait."
An open letter to the families of the victims and survivors of the Parkland school shooting,Based,PPEcel,"Oct 18, 2022",30000,189,"Dear Normies,

Four years ago, as poor Nicky Cruz here was being arraigned, he offered you a deal. He would plead guilty to 17 counts of first-degree murder and another 17 counts of attempted first-degree murder right then and there if you didn't pursue the death penalty. This was a deal that made sense. He would be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. And you would get to avoid the trauma and expense of a trial.

But you said no. Most of you demanded the death penalty for 19-year-old Nicky. And so more than four years later, after COVID-related delays, the jury came back with a verdict. And it wasn't the verdict you wanted.

So what sympathy do you think you deserve? You knew the rules. The jury had to be unanimous. You decided to gamble on a death penalty question in Broward County, the most liberal county in Florida, where Biden voters outnumbered Trump voters 2-to-1 in 2020. And not so surprisingly, you lost. Three jurors voted to show mercy to Nicky Cruz after he showed none to 17 of your loved ones. You would have been better off by taking his deal. The proceedings would have been over years ago.

Now you want to stage press conferences and say that the ""jury failed you"" and that you're ""disgusted by the jury""? Now you're mad ""at the system"" and think that the verdict was ""insane"" and that ""justice wasn't served today""?


View: https://vimeo.com/761703712

Sweaty, that's an entitled mindset. So I humbly present to you the following advice:

Educate yourself.
You may be upset that a jury, not a judge, ultimately decided the sentence of Nicky Cruz. But Nicky Cruz's Sixth Amendment rights include the right to a jury trial at the penalty phase of a capital case. In Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584 (2002), Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion holding that judges sitting without a jury cannot find aggravating factors justifying a death sentence. Her logic was impeccable and I encourage you to read the decision. And just 11 years later, the U.S. Supreme Court applied Ring to strike down Florida's capital sentencing scheme in Hurst v. Florida, 577 U.S. 92 (2013). That is why Florida law now empowers jurors, not judges, to make these monumental decisions.

You may also be upset that just one or two or three jurors were allowed to prevent the imposition of a death sentence. But that is the state of Florida statute, and any attempt to change it for future cases is unlikely to survive federal judicial review. While the U.S. Supreme Court has never directly opined on whether jury unanimity is required for the penalty phase of a capital trial, just two years ago in Ramos v. Louisiana, 140 S. Ct. 1390 (2020), the Court held that the Sixth Amendment requires unanimity in the guilt phase of all criminal trials. The possibility is remote that the Court would agree to a lesser standard where a defendant's life or death is on the line.

Know and accept that your sad feelings do not get to override the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Boohoo .

Be less entitled and selfish.
Yes, it may have been upsetting to hear graphic testimony describing how your sons and daughters were ruthlessly shredded by a semi-automatic rifle. But as I said, you are not entitled to a death sentence.



It is selfish for you to be upset at Chief Assistant Public Defender Melisa McNeill (pictured here) and the other defense attorneys who worked tirelessly to defend their client, Nicky Cruz. Some of you whined loudly at what you considered was the ""lack of empathy"" from the defense. But it was not their job to show you ""empathy"". It was their professional obligation to defend their client to the best of their abilities, and if that meant ignoring your feelings, that's too bad.

It is selfish for you to be upset at the jurors. They gave up months of their life to serve our legal system. They carefully reviewed many pieces of evidence, much of it graphic, and it is likely that the experience left many of them mentally and emotionally scarred. Be grateful that they were willing to sit through your whining testimony.

It is selfish for you to be upset at the system. The system does not cater to you and you only. It caters to all of us. The right to an impartial jury trial found in the Sixth Amendment, like many other rights enshrined in the Constitution, are rooted in the principles of limited government and individual liberty. This system functions as a check, albeit an imperfect one, on the executive branch of government. It is a feature, not a flaw, that the evidentiary bar required for a conviction, let alone a capital sentence, is higher relative to the criminal justice system in an authoritarian dictatorship.

Demonstrate empathy.
Aside from the constitutional reasons I stated above, the reason why the jury system requires unanimity for a death sentence is to decrease the likelihood that an innocent person will be wrongfully executed. If there is any doubt, the system is designed to err in favor of leniency, because death is the ultimate, irreversible sentence. Did you know that since 1973, 190 death row inmates have been exonerated in the United States? That means 190 people, many of them BIPOC, have been sentenced to death for a crime that they did not commit.

By criticizing the system, you are demonstrating your lack of empathy for those that the system is also designed to protect: the innocent and their loved ones. Can you imagine how it must feel to be strapped to a gurney and poisoned for a crime that you know you did not commit? No, you can't. You expect empathy from others, so why is it that you lack empathy for others? Remember, it is the foundation of our jurisprudence that it is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.



Nicky Cruz also deserves empathy. Imagine the torment and bullying that he must have experienced for there to be enough hatred within him to make the fateful decision to slaughter your sons and daughters at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Thankfully, three jurors showed him the empathy he deserved, even though you showed none.

Accept that life isn't fair.
Because it isn't. Your offspring are dead. Nicky Cruz will be placed in protective custody and he will receive three hot meals a day, showers, and mail from his fans and admirers. He may even be allowed a tablet, radio, and TV in his cell with good behavior.

Acknowledge your privilege.
The fact that you were even able to reproduce accords a level of genetic privilege that many others do not have. Some of you can always create a replacement child, right?

Be grateful for what you have (left).
Repeat after me:

“Someone somewhere has it much worse than you, so don’t complain.”
“Learn to be happy with yourself. Don’t make your well-being dependent on your (lack of) children.”
“Having non-dead children won’t solve all your problems.”
“People with living children have problems too, you know? The grass is always greener on the other side of the cemetery fence.”

Seek therapy.
Self-explanatory.

Well, I hope this is helpful. Sweaty, I hope that one day you will grow to accept that our legal system and our society more generally do not cater solely to your hurt feelings, no matter how upset you are by the brutal mass murder of your children and their educators. Mass shootings are a fact of life in our society, and you need to understand that. Take out a life insurance policy, perhaps.

Sincerely,
PPEcel

How Statutory Rape Laws are a Subsidy on Female Sexual Market Value.,Blackpill,Zer0/∞,"May 2, 2023",13000,117,"Statutory rape laws as we know them are a product of the Victorian period. These laws were originally made to protect the economically valuable virginity of unmarried young women. It was also a reaction of working class men to the force of hypergamy — the female instinct to select men of higher status. It was a way to prevent wealthier, more powerful men from monopolizing young working class women in rapidly growing urban areas.

As the 20th century progressed, virginity was no longer a prerequisite for marriage. The original justifications for expanded statutory rape laws became obsolete and forgotten… but they remained for a reason.

Female power in society was growing rapidly as the industrial world matured. The old laws very much benefited women of reproductive age. Females 18-35 found themselves miraculously protected from the depredations of their fiercest competitors — the up and coming ones. The temporal conveyor belt that ruthlessly cycled women out of the market was effectively slowed down by 3-4 years.

Females have always been able to benefit more from cooperation while males have had to spend more of their energy on competition. This is the natural result of a zero sum situation in which one man can fertilize countless women. The sex that has to break ranks first and compete among itself ‘loses.’ The party that can cooperate more effectively for longer is able to dictate the terms.

However, statutory rape laws have distorted the biological game even more strongly in favor of women.

We might call the resulting trend ‘hyper-hypergamy.’

Though females have always been the gatekeepers of human reproduction, their enormous power had a major limiting factor. They had only a handful of years at peak value in which they had to settle with the best mate they could find. If they did not hurry, their opportunity would be squandered and a new generation of young women would be taking their pick of the richest, most desirable men.

Indeed, it does much to explain our present world if we understand how statutory rape laws and other pro-female policies have changed society. Feminism and the overall decline in female standards of behavior can be explained by a shift in the balance of power. Females now simply have fewer restraints on their behavior.

Unfortunately for women, the present distorted order is unsustainable:

1) A group that adopts Victorian-style statutory rape laws will experience a drop in overall fertility and an increase in birth defects.

If a society tries to keep its most fertile and desirable women from reproducing while promoting the interests of women who are in the twilight of their reproductive years, the rate of fertility and the quality of offspring must fall relative to those societies that subscribe to biological reality.

2) Historically, it often takes a man a decade or two after reaching adulthood to get established.

It’s sink or swim — of all the men who ever lived, only a minority managed to have kids. The male’s main advantage is more time — nearly twice as much as a female has. Hyper-hypergamy encourages women to hold out for an additional 3-4 years before bearing children. Meanwhile, men must compete more intensely than ever to secure women with fewer remaining reproductive years.

When older women have artificially high value, the man who can finally afford a family at age 35-40 is going to have difficulty achieving reproductive success when the most fertile women are out of his range. At present, a 35 year-old man is going to be lucky to find a mate more than a few years younger. A woman past age 30 is already beyond her best reproductive years. The probability of genetic defects in any resulting children is much higher, assuming the female is still able to conceive. Thus, we predictably see ‘fertility therapy’ growing into a huge industry in the Westernized world.

Where hyper-hypergamy reigns, the only men deemed fit for fertile wombs are those born into wealth, and a handful of ‘naturals,’ lucky celebrities and entrepreneurs who make it big while they’re young.

3) When women are approaching the height of their beauty in their later teens, they are one of society’s most powerful means of motivating men to aspire to great things.

Great civilizations are those that find constructive ways to channel the abundant energies of their men. The right incentives must be there. Not only does a great reward spur men on to great deeds, men who perceive that the best is given to the corrupt and undeserving will rebel and look for ways to undermine the system. Societies that fail to offer their men sufficient incentives to act in the collective interest perish.

This said — we might look at who the present society rewards with many of its best young women…

An assortment of high school athletes, class presidents, and homecoming kings who have yet to accomplish or contribute anything. They are showered with society’s greatest gifts early in life for throwing balls around, attending parties, and generally acting as thugs.

In short, high school football teams get a steady supply of young virgins while all other males are expected to work hard for their leavings for the rest of their lives.

What message is sent to the majority of high school males who see these thugs monopolizing the sexual market as part of their formative experience? Will they be predisposed towards trusting or helping the society that demands their effort and productivity? Most will not think any of this out on a conscious level, but they will follow their self-interest all the same. Where might we predict that a society like this is headed?

Conclusion:

Victorian-style statutory rape laws may seem a sweet deal for many women, but both men and women lose in the long term.

Women 18-35 enjoy heightened social status, but they lose some of their most valuable reproductive years in their teens — before environmental factors have had a chance to damage the supply of eggs they carry with them from birth. Thus, the two years from 16-18 are far more biologically valuable to her than are the years from 33-35 in which she’s spending thousands of dollars on fertility therapy and dealing with exponentially greater odds of conceiving a child with Down syndrome.

With biology already heavily skewed in favor of women, further inflation in the sexual market creates an untenable situation for men. The resulting cutthroat competition interferes with the ability of men to cooperate and accomplish goals that further the aims of society. Society becomes less stable and less innovative. Social unrest and upheaval become inevitable.

Ultimately, an understanding of underlying sexual politics gives one a much better model for predicting the crowd’s behavior than does focusing on individual movements and ideologies."
The Ugly Laws 1867 - 1974: Cruelty Imposed Upon Sub-5s,Blackpill,Esoteric7,"Dec 17, 2023",2000,20,"Introduction:
The Ugly Laws, prevalent in the United States between 1867 to 1974, reflected a society marred by discrimination and cruelty towards individuals deemed physically unattractive. These laws targeted people with visible disabilities, reinforcing prejudiced notions and subjecting them to profound injustices.

Origin and Evolution of Ugly Laws:
The Ugly Laws emerged in the late 1800s, gaining traction in several cities across the U.S. Designed to maintain public order, these laws disproportionately targeted individuals with disabilities, particularly those with visible deformities.

Portland, Oregon enacted an ugly law in 1881:

‘Any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated, or in any way deformed, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, or an improper person to be allowed in or on the streets, highways, thoroughfares, or public places in the city, shall not therein or thereon expose himself or herself to public view, under the penalty of a fine of $1 for each offense (Chicago City Code 1881).’​
The fine of $1 equates to more than $30 in 2023. Punishments for violating an ugly law ranged from incarceration to fines of up to $50 for each offense or sent to a poor house or work farm.






Cruelty in Enforcement:
The enforcement of the Ugly Laws was characterized by heartless practices. Law enforcement officials, in collaboration with local authorities, would detain and penalize anyone perceived as unsightly, casting aside fundamental human rights in favor of an arbitrary and discriminatory aesthetic standard. Ugly people were seen as ruining the flow of life or disturbing the peace.





Dehumanization of Ugly Individuals:
The laws not only barred individuals from public spaces but also contributed to the dehumanization of those deemed unattractive.

Forced to hide their appearance or face legal consequences, these individuals were stripped of their dignity and basic freedoms, perpetuating a cycle of isolation, marginalization, anxiety, depression, and a sense of worthlessness.

The Ugly Laws often led to public humiliation, as those deemed ""ugly"" were forced to wear badges or face other visible markers of their status.





Impact on Employment and Economic Opportunities:
Ugly Laws impacted the economic prospects of affected individuals. Discrimination based on appearance hindered their ability to secure gainful employment, perpetuating cycles of poverty and reinforcing societal prejudices.

Legal Foundations and Prejudice:
Examining the legal foundations of these laws reveals a systemic bias against individuals with disabilities. The laws were built on misguided perceptions of normalcy and aesthetics, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and encouraging the exclusion of those who did not conform to narrow societal standards.

Some argue that the constraints placed on individuals with disabilities stem more from the imagined challenges and risks associated with disability than from the actual limitations posed by the disability itself.





Challenging the Ugly Laws:
Some individuals and advocacy groups began to challenge the Ugly Laws. Their efforts contributed to a growing awareness of the inherent cruelty and injustice embedded in these regulations, eventually leading to their decline in the mid-20th century.





The Importance of Historical Reflection:
The Ugly Laws serve as a stark reminder of the consequences of being ugly. By examining this dark chapter in history, we are reminded of the vile evilness of normies who marginalized and dehumanized sub-5s."

I EXPECT NOTHING LESS FROM .IS, GET IT OUT WHILE YOU CAN. YES, TELL ME HOW YOU DIDN'T READ A SINGLE WORD....HOW I AM A GRAY....I WANT TO HEAR IT ALL. 

Greetings. In this post, I'd like to lay down some fundamental blackpill theory from I suppose a more biological/evobio/evopsych/sociological perspective on why women behave the way they do. This is a compilation of essentially gathered information gotten through various different sources, including scientific literature (which can also be found within this forum and/or the incel wiki, among other places), secondary sources, and so on. In true blackpill fashion, I do not intend to prescribe behavior - I merely seek to provide an explanation/summary of the fundamental biological principles of the blackpill that have been brought forth as arguments in its support, which I feel are seldom discussed. My intention with this is to provide both incels, blackpillers in general, and outsiders with a comprehensive overview of at least a part of the blackpill. I am not a scientist in any way, and my only contact with the profession is college-level biology classes I took while still in school.

Context and Disclaimers​When I use the term 'blackpill' in this post, I specifically refer to the blackpill on human mating preference and relationship dynamics - something that is so foundational to society. The term 'blackpill,' in general, has two meanings: it can be seen as an uncomfortable truth, or it can just be seen as the deeper truth hidden behind the veil of what initially is present in front of something. Oftentimes, due to the nature of life and reality, the two are intertwined - specifically, that they are double entailed (one equals the other and vice-versa). The blackpill is, essentially, in its most literal definition a packet of information. That is all it is. It does not prescribe behavior, it does not make any specific calls for action, and it is not specifically associated with any ideology. You can be a capitalist or communist and still be blackpilled. You can be a liberal or a fascist and still be blackpilled. You can be a theist or an atheist and still be blackpilled. The idea that the blackpill is a white supremacist ideology, as presented by mainstream sources, is objectively false for the simple fact that an extremely large amount of 'blackpillers' (defined as individuals who subscribe to these sets of beliefs) and the ones most affected by it are non-white ethnics. The reasons for this will be discussed in the JBW section.

It is important to remember that the blackpill deals in truths about generalized patterns. Human relationships on the individual level are always more complex, if for no other reason than for the simple fact there are just too many variables to account for even on the individual level. Each change in scope (micro vs. macroscopic) has its own changes in variables as well, as these all interact and combine/counteract eachother in very complex ways. For all effective purposes, as real life - practical application - has shown us, you're still not any less fucked because of this (and why exactly this is the case will hopefully become clearer as this post progresses). For the sake of transparency and comprehensiveness, however, I do have to point this out, or else I'd be doing any reader of this a disservice. In addition, when specifically talking about the female sex it is necessary to consider the response. It is true that there may not be an immediate, quantifiable, direct, and tangible result that will arise out of reading this; the female sex is calculating in this regard, so it is much better to just ghost and hope this goes away. An attempt, however, has to be made, for what it’s worth it.

Above all, one must remember that the blackpill takes a lot out of a normal person. It is difficult to process, and even harder to sort truth from falsehood from half-truth...and so on and so forth. It takes a lot out of someone and after a while one may start to lose their own faculty of judgement, beginning to hastily and uncritically swallow up everything as being objectively true. The macro effects of blackpill media are also something to consider: though I do not intend to dispute the truths, when viewed from the outside - especially when regarded as an ideology - it is hard not to notice it that it essentially has the demoralizing and enervating effect at the (((elites))) have been known to produce in efforts to subvert societies. There's no solid connection yet that can be pointed out, but it's something one should keep in mind.

Economics Applied to the Dating Market​Economics and Sexual Economics Theory (essentially the application of the law of supply and demand into the sexual marketplace) is one of the most comprehensive methods one can apply in order to gain a deeper understanding of what we call the blackpill. In unregulated dating markets (no forced marriages, no slutshaming, etc.), women turn out to be the chief sexual selectors and gatekeepers of sex. In economics, this is called the principle of least interest: when an activity depends on mutual agreement, the person/entity with the least interest decides the terms of that activity. This is because the person with the most interest has fewer options, thus is more likely to compromise than the other party. Women desire initiating sex with a partner of average attractiveness much less than men. As a result, most men have fewer options and - hence - more likely to make compromises in order to be able to attract the other sex. Making compromises means dating down in terms of value, which means women automatically date up. In SET, women sexually commodify themselves with a certain exchange value whenever they reject or accept men based on what they have to offer. Sex, then, becomes a resource in itself that men can purchase by amassing an array of valued goods: genetic material (looks, athletic performance), money, status, etc. (both material and non-material; socioeconomic). Women compete in “selling high” by strategically withholding sex, thereby increasing male sexual frustration/desperation in order to inflate the price of sex. This allows women to set terms, including only forcing them to commit to resource provision (even in societies in which resources are abundant), allowing themselves an abundance of males, and so on. Women slut-shame (and therefore also want to maintain an image of being pure virgins, among other reasons) in order to maintain the value of sex, as sex given away freely lowers its value and, therefore, womens’ leverage over men. Women collude in this way, essentially forming “cartels,” inciting one another’s hypergamy and becoming a leisure class. This is only one factor affecting the disparity between male and female SMV, however.

Hypergamy (not just socioeconomic, but looks-based as well)​Hypergamy is the action of dating up in terms of value, whether it be relative to a previous partner or to any other males available; the benchmark is not limited to herself or the social standing of her family. There are multiple forms: looks hypergamy, resource hypergamy, status hypergamy, and so on. Hypergamy can be easily explained through Bateman’s Principle and Briffault’s Law, along with the relative disparity between both sexes’ SMV. An emphasis is rightfully placed on looks hypergamy, due to the importance of clearly visible genetic features - signs of traits adaptive to the environment and overall physical health - that can be passed down to offspring. Variability hypothesis also states that males exhibit a greater variety in many traits than females, such as sexual preferences, social attitudes, behaviors, intelligence, strength, other physical straits, genetic variation (in part due to mutation), etc. The only exception to this is fear and emotionality, which women show a greater variability towards. Male sexual desire is much more varied in that they more readily copulated with females; even unattractive women and obese ones receive much more attention than even average men (Juggernaut Law: female SMV is unstoppable, like a Juggernaut). This phenomenon becomes even more evident when women diagnosed with various mental illnesses have twice the fertility rates as do men with the same ones. This is especially devastating for unattractive men, as they can no longer lower their own standards/compromise more in order to establish a functioning relationship or to even get short-term sex. Women also seem to engage in higher levels of mate choice copying than men, stemming from either greater conformity/hypoagency (explaining a higher proneness to hysteria) or perhaps as a means of choosing high-status men explained by the bodyguard hypothesis and female hypergamy. Such a mate, in turn, serves as a confirmation of the female’s own SMV and gives her a sense of prestige/validation, with her potential offspring also inheriting traits seen as ‘valuable’ and benefiting from the males’ high-status position. Women get part of a man's social status;

Bateman's Principle​The inherent SMV - and, as a result, disparity in inherent individual value - between men and women arises as a result of Bateman’s Principle. Bateman’s Principle deals with parental investment: it states that females tend to produce fewer offspring than males do, but do so more reliably due to differences in parental investment. Conversely, a few males can have lots of offspring but give out low parental investment. Males, essentially, have more variance in reproductive success. Bateman’s Principle stance on females can be explained thusly:

Pregnancy is often extremely dangerous for females
Pregnancy is extremely time-consuming and incapacitating for the body
Pregnancy is metabolically taxing
Pregnancy is dangerous due to the large size of the human head and high birth weight relative to the mother’s size
The pocket shape of female genitals is more vulnerable to STDs
The offspring have a higher dependence on the mother, as only she is guaranteed to be present at birth
Newborns are dependent upon a mother’s breast milk
Human offspring are among the most dependent offspring of all animals due to their complex socialization process and slow brain development that allows for higher intelligence, with women historically being much more involved in raising the offspring than men
Comparing female egg cells to male sperm cells, it can be seen that the latter require much fewer resources and carry no risk of death or incapacitation. There is also no guarantee of the male having to stay following pregnancy, either. Men are free to engage in promiscuity with not much to lose, as in doing so they increase their chances of having surviving offspring and passing down genetic legacy - an indicator of both sexual and evolutionary success.

Due to this disparity, females have a lower expected lifetime reproductive success and a lower life history speed. As a result, each of the few offspring is subjected to higher standards - meaning women must subconsciously seek out competitive genetic material, be possessed of a lower sexual libido in order to further facilitate the choosing process, and, as a result, become the gatekeepers of sex and sexual selectors. They choose which men may stay in the genetic pool and which do not. Males’ high sex drive, conversely, creates extreme demand for women, subjecting the market to further pressure and increasing male frustration/desperation. Bateman’s Principle fully explains hypergamy and Sexual Economics Theory.

Due to their biological roles, females have a different evolutionary goal than men do. They are the physically weaker sex, and, as a result, focus strongly on resource provisioning and maintenance of their physical security. Strong, tall, masculine high-testosterone males are a chief contender for this rule, having evolved specific traits/had them sexually selected for in order to fit this role. It is debatable, however, how advantageous having a “strong high-T masculine” look is compared to just having a lean body, clear skin, and good bones/hair: ideally, a male would have all such features - though it is argued that, especially in the 21st century, merely possessing the latter (a more feminized, “pretty-boy” look) is enough. Height is universally selected for, however, being a clear sign of genetic quality. The Bodyguard Hypothesis states that women choose to pair bond with the most dominant man available to them in order to be protected from other contending males, especially sexually coercive ones (behavior which is explained by Bateman’s Principle and sexual economics). Women arguably need this protection because all men are possessed of a much greater physical strength than almost all women. Regardless, despite looks demands, females also on average have a much greater demand for attention and are more neurotic/paranoid than do men. This makes sense, as they need the attention for the offspring and benefit from the increased paranoia due to threats to the undeveloped and inexperienced offspring’s life.

Just Be White (JBW) Theory​Just Be White (JBW) theory states that whites have a serious advantage over all other races. This is because ethnics are of varyingly lower attractiveness than whites; many times, they are shorter, have smaller penises, and smaller/less dimorphic frames - with an extreme case of this being asians, including Indians. Another area in which they can fall short is just being facially less attractive on average - something blacks suffer from, despite often being taller, having better penis sizes, and being possessed of more masculine frames than usually any other race. The evolutionary reasons for this are complex and multi-faceted; I can only speculate: African women had so much abundance provided to them by the naturally warm and fertile lands of Africa that they were essentially granted conditions of material independence; they could afford to exclusively select partners based on pure sexual attractiveness rather than anything else, leading to the above-mentioned strengths in Africans. However, their poor performance compared to European faces could potentially be explained by African women of that time period still only being able to choose from among the men already present in Africa; it's essentially about local effects. The effect, however, of that pure look preference by females can be argue to still be clearly observable there. Now, nutritional and other factors can definitely play a role - but, then again, so could they in other areas of the world. In other places in the world, inbreeding and forced marriages that sough to fight and overpower the female need to mate with sexually attractive men can also explain why many of these races are less attractive.

This still leaves many questions unanswered. Why is the white skin color so preferred? It's not just Europeans' facial features that give their advantage, though that is - by far - the largest one that they have in my opinion, but their skin tone. Why this is the case, I couldn't say; you could propose various theories for this, and I've even heard of schizo batshit insane theories point out to humans being created as a slave race for their raw materials, and that white skin produces the best parchment or whatever (scroll down a bit, it's the post by the user usselo). I'm only referring to this in order to put things into perspective, and give some food for thought - not necessarily because I believe or because I wish for anyone else to believe in it (>inb4 tails or whoever makes a video using my post to showcase this forum is retarded). Whatever the case, this preference exists across all cultures and races - what with that one white-skinned blue-eyed Pakistani coffee/ice cream vendor (or whatever the hell he was) becoming a celebrity and opening up an international chain. He lucked the hell out.

Furthermore, as a side note, it can also be argued that the lack in need to choose high-status men due to this (traits often strongly correlated with a high work drive/intelligence) has essentially been a main factor leading to the African propensity for violence (a genetically masculine trait) and low intelligence (makes sense if all you select for is looks/bodyguards). I expect this information will make fans of a certain Dr. Verwoerd in this forum very happy, though this is ultimately a disastrous scenario for the human race as a large portion has essentially been disadvantaged in a very destructive way that leaves them prey to not only others but their own selves. I will talk more about the dilemma of status vs. looks later.

Skeletal Observations​But I digress. Getting back on topic: from what I have seen and concluded women, more or less - in my opinion, at least - are attracted to a person's skeleton, which includes their skull (which, in turn, obviously includes their face). It dictates their facial structure, their frame, how much muscle they can pack on, and so on and so forth. Even with shit skin and muscle genetics, a good skeleton can save you; it is the basis for good looks, though certainly not the end-all be-all. The skeleton is the only feature in your body that controls TWO (2) of the THREE (3) factors of the incel pyramid - those two being face and height, and the pyramid in general being face, height, and race. Remember when I said that despite outliers existing, you're still likely to be fucked? It's because those soyentists and medcels that receive trillions in funding still haven't found a way to reliable reshape/remold the skeleton. They can't do it! They can't, they just can't, they don't know how to. Or, at least, that's what they are telling us (who the hell knows what the elites have access to). Whether this is due to funds being stolen, poured into the wrong projects, poor coordination/communication, sheer laziness, or whatever the fuck it is, I don't know. To any STEMcels/medcels reading this, get your fucking ass into gear. This is not a party. You academics have a zero-tolerance policy for mediocrity, but expect the same to not apply to you. Pathetic.

(Potential) Societal Degradation due to Lookism​Touching a bit more on the topic of status vs. looks in terms of mate selection, the optimization problem women usually faced was important as it essentially forced women to have to select men on traits beyond the superficial. Status and resources correlate strongly with intelligence, innovation, dedication, drive, hard work (which is also partly genetic), and so on - all traits essential to the creation and maintenance of a high civilization. If all that is thrown out, however, there may be societal degradation; ending up with a society of inefficient, apathetic supermodels. The only caveat to this, however, is that good look shave shown to be correlated to increased intelligence in some studies - in an apparent show of good genes coming in packages/bundles, apparently.

Granted, then there's all the direct consequences of hyper-materialism/lookism: the depression, rejection, etc. But since men are so sedated, and women are more or less content with the way things are (and I'll elaborate on this down below in the next section), things are unlikely to change on their own.

Briffault's Law​Most men are raised in this blue pill mindset of trying to seek out an ""equal"" companion, which is not the case due to hypergamy. This leads to men trying to treat women they know as friends, but men and women understand ""friendship"" differently due to their different life experience. This contradiction then causes a lot of confusion and hurt, and not helped by the fact that currently is in a hyper-egalitarian and gynocentric stage/position in the historical cycle. People just get confused, and pain inevitably ensues - though, keep in mind here that when I say ""hurt"" I am by no means implying women want to go back to the 1950s where they had no rights. An example we can study is the LJBF rejection.

LJBF-type rejections take several years out of men; one thing that women especially seem to not appreciate much of the time. When a man is rejected this way and his emotions are toyed with, they quite literally eat away at his life years. It is a form of slow death, though for most women it never enters their minds they do anything else other than “being friendly.” But the road to Hell is paved with good intentions, is it not? Evolution has certainly made it so that men feel this pain much more acutely for a reason, just like with sexual jealousy, which women also do not experience in the way men do. Perhaps rejection is always better than regret, though: it is better to endure a bitter and painful lesson rather than laying down and rotting in self-denial. Word of mouth is that there are plenty of instances of men killing themselves upon finally waking up too late, the accumulated regret hitting them all at once. A wise man learns from the deaths of others, though emotional attachment may persist. Rationally and logically, one knows when to conclude it’s over - but it still takes time to register emotionally. It is oftentimes an ego preservation mechanism - a reaction - trying to compensate for the rejection by looking for ways to justify itself. A good example can be seen from social media: when a young man gets dumped, he begins posting all these status updates and profile pictures trying to show he is living his best life. Cope or rope is an apt saying, in this regard. It is all in vain, however, as women simply just do not experience the sense of romantic regret they do when we see an ex prospect post glow up photos or what not. Women move on a lot faster than males, and men - especially in the West - are very interchangeable and replaceable (Briffault's Law). Orbiters are a source of attention for women they can pick and choose from. In most cases, they serve as backup options in case women ever become bored or otherwise dissatisfied with their current partner. 

""The female, not the male, determines all the conditions of the animal family. Where the female can derive no benefit from association with the male, no such association takes place."" - Robert Stephen Briffault MC. Women will, as a general rule, only interact with you if they believe they can gain something by it. When she perceives no benefit, the relationship ends. Benefits can range from a wide variety of things: attention, company, emotional support, good feelings, sexual pleasure, good genes, resources and wealth, access to a better social circle/greater status, help with work, etc. Is it cynical? Yes. But it has been remarkably enduring ever since its old redpill days, and it still has great predictive value.

In a sense, women are incredibly luck they are able to drop and forget us so easily. It is rare for a woman to grieve as deeply as a man. But, in the past, women had children to feed during cold harsh winters; the death of the male was no excuse to let their child and themselves die. To let the species die off. I am no simp or apologist, but I can understand mother Nature's actions. That's, however, another difference between the sexes: women live more superficial, normie lives. Female IQ is similar to male IQ, yes, but it has far less variation; it's very mid, I suppose you could say. On the other hand, men are gifted/cursed with greater variation - meaning a greater proclivity to genius and/or madness. It's why men are so overrepresented relative to women in the achievements of high civilizations.

G.K. Chesterton said, ""Women are always authoritarian; they are always above or below; that is why marriage is a sort of poetical see-saw."" CS Lewis also said something similar - commenting that women, due to their biology, are more predisposed to partial interests and they have a harder time being impartial/neutral/fair. Essentially, they’re always seeking the greater advantage for themselves and their offspring - as all mothers in nature do (and not something I necessarily fault them for). For a civilization to survive and flourish, however, you need to have cooperation. This requires justice and peace, and this is where man’s authority (today demonized as patriarchy) has often been the lynchpin and safeguard of civilization. Case in point, those married females with families who tried breaking out their prisoner boyfriends and going on the run - one of them killing herself, the other using the car her own cuck husband bought for her (JFL). Also goes to show you what a woman is willing to do for you, however, if she believes you're worth her time/she's genuinely attracted/in love with you. Brutal.

Either sex has its pros and cons, essentially. Women are probably perfectly capable of entering STEM and being leaders and whatnot; they just probably aren't as interested in it as men are - and if they are, it will be for different reasons. Men are the risk-taking sex; women not so much. Of course, it is men that will take the blame for this - but I digress.

Conclusion and Closing Remarks​Personally, I think this is the most disgusting aspect of the blackpilled reality and the modern world/society we live in: the commodification of humans (and not just in the economic sense, what with automation, workers' rights being thrown to shit, etc. but also due to the blackpill, the materialism, the bastardization of everything). We have truly come full circle: yes, women are sold into sex slavery or whatever - but men are also used and abused, then dumped. Men are more directly violent, women are more cunning - yet with the amount of male sedation going on, even this male violence has slowly started to die down.

When it comes to incels/blackpillers hating women, it is understandable. It is a humiliating existence, and you're not even allowed to die in a war trying to correct it. When you logically understand women and see them for what they are, it becomes difficult to hate them; it's simply their nature. Same for us men, I suppose. Failing to grasp this leads many blackpillers to resentful MSTOW circles or the type of cringe, deranged, and entitled feminists that stalk Reddit forums and complain about men all day.

When Apartheid South Africa was surrounded by enemy nations seeking to overthrow its government and, essentially, take it out on its ruling white minority, it had to get its act into gear. Additional economic sanctions by the west lead to the nation becoming an isolated pariah state - leading to the government taking account of everything that was coming to destroy its nation and classifying it as a sort of 'Total Onslaught'; a mass of enemy combatants, policies, states, governments, and diplomacy headed its way, seeking to destroy it. In attempting to overcome this adversity, South Africa developed robust arms industries and a world-class military capable of defending itself. It produced the best artillery system known to man at the time, its own aircraft, armored vehicles, consumer products, and even all things nuclear - from energy, to weapons. I use the example of Apartheid South Africa for two reasons: one, because apartheid is essentially what many of us are effectively undergoing through today - the irony, essentially - and two, because I wanted to show an example of someone/something bracing for something big and doing all it can to prepare. I propose we today - not only incels, not only blackpillers, not only men, but society and humanity in general - face a sort of Total Onslaught of similar, if not greater, proportions. A much more insidious onslaught, yes, but an onslaught nonetheless.

About that stolenhistory thing: if you're a believer in conspiracy theories/spiritualism/psychic powers and such, it could be part of antediluvian history. In Judeo-Christian scripture, it's written that the world was once so wicked that God essentially hit a giant reset button and caused massive calamities in order to reset things. Maybe some of what the guy in that post describes are would-be relics from that period. As for JBW and races, things are complex; yes, there's differences, but ultimately humanity should work together. The new covenant suggests that God's intention is, perhaps, a unified humanity - a new spiritual race, as Evola might have put it, which could perhaps be the only solution to our issues. Warhammer 40k style, where the Emperor wanted to unify humanity and ascend it into a psychic race. Granted, that's a very literal example - spiritual probably has more of a noospheric context here, though you never know. Such a thing could also help to free us from material constraints, and even the blackpill - as the blackpill is, essentially, one of the biggest manifestations of materialism in existence as of now. Of course, you can then explore the thought that the(((elites))) bastardized and inverted this unity plan - turning it into a carnal unification (racemixing, extreme egalitarianism, etc.) first and foremost without regard to its intended spiritual unity. Miscegenation - aside from causing loss of national identity, which is a strong unifier and motivator, source of pride, and gives someone the right of quickly and reliably tracing their ancestry, etc. - also displays a higher frequency of dysgenic effects and psychological problems that arise in the kids. There's also issues with stable family formation that often come about. That's a really deep topic, however - though some initial tentative conclusions can be that miscegenating relationships should not be encouraged as much given the painful consequences they can entail, and due to the fact that downplaying negative effects plays into the aims of racial fetishists (many of whom are allied with the people that have put us into this situation to begin with). Regardless, this bastardization of a unified humanity is, I guess, possibly what's making us all eat shit right now. That's what the Devil in Christianity does: takes what is good (because he has no original power to make something of his own), and bastardizes it into something evil. I'm not saying all that I have mentioned in this paragraph should be taken literally; if we are to assume higher civilizations existed in the past (and they would have, at least in my opinion, had to as a lot of the information presented here and much more was known by our ancestors in at least some way, shape, or form), then we can take religions, myths, etc. to be allegories/metaphors/or at least be partially literal and partially metaphorical. The Ancients often speak in - to us - meaningless riddles and cryptic messages. You have to put in the work to understand them, and even then it's not the whole piece of the puzzle that's required. We will likely never understand the relation between the deep state and prehistory.

Sorry for taking such a philosophical tangent, but with such large amounts of human suffering you more or less are forced into such a discussion. These are just some thoughts that popped up during discussion with an acquaintance of mine. Take them as you will.

It is important to look at the blackpill not just as a tool - as it's not really a tool for anything, refer to the first paragraph - but, rather, as a universal truth. Something which an ideology can at least partly be built around; something by which a logos can form out of, but not necessarily an ideology/logos/word on its own. But one should be careful, as the blackpill is a heavy burden to bear; take care of yourselves, seek comfort and contact with others, share ideas, thoughts, but be mindful. I'd personally advise against it become a religion/substitute for one, or an absolute truth; be careful of letting a desolate materialism take over you. Take care of yourself when looking deep into the blackpill on relationships and other blackpills in every other area, lest you end up like that one guy that posted on this forum to talk about how his decaying tooth tasted like pork (literally puts the R in LDAR JFL). Confront your own mortality, confront the fact you may die alone and unloved by any woman for no good reason or through and fault of your own, and find what peace you can in whatever way you can. Let life become a form of amusement; look at clown world, and just laugh. It's difficult to keep going in such a world where you are unloved whilst others are; go to work, do this, do that, but reap no rewards. But keep in mind that the system will punish you if you do not do that. Most importantly, recognize you must find your own purpose. Also, look out for people who try to instigate something; not all can be trusted (e.g. Bible saying ""they who try to save their life will surely lose it"" - very cryptic and mysterious, and not necessarily in the biblical conspiracy theory sense but in that of conveying profound truths you can't grasp by secular reasoning alone). Basically it's just feds (or generally servants of the powers that be) trying to mold new ""extremist threats."" Don't take the bait, don't trust glowies, don't trust feds. Most, if not all, rebellions/insurgencies require the backing of an external actor in order to succeed. If you don't have that, it's tough to do anything. It's difficult to say what one should do: to act or not to act? That is the question. Ultimately, it is up to the individual.
Personally? Take the relationship blackpill. The women we love/loved are getting their brains fucked out right as we speak, meanwhile we are banned from their life permanently. Jobs and degrees, means to survive, land, pride, honor, and so much else taken from us - forcing to watch as the world becomes a bleaker place day by day. We have been humbled, we have been denied, and we must face the fact that the world is against us and we are all by ourselves. Even if we do not care about it anymore, our receptors have been fried and we have been forced into an unsustainable position in our own lives - not just because of abysmal relationship dynamics, but because of economic, academic, societal, administrative, and so many other reasons.

I like to think that one day, we will be there to return the favor (in Paradox Interactive's Stellaris sci-fi grand strategy game). That the storm rises only so that the thunderbolt may fall.

I believe that ultimately, if this species as we know it is to survive, it will have to tackle all aforementioned issues in the relatively near future once and for all. How this could be done, however, still eludes me. One thing is certain, though: in doing so, we will either ascend to new Olympian heights of glory - or fall into the depths of despair; the pit of a new Dark Age.

Brain Structure Different by Gender,Blackpill,incels.REEEE,"Jul 22, 2018",8000,46,"Feminists have long stressed that men and women are equal. There seems to be an unspoken implication that differences in our behavior are caused by our society rather than by pure human nature. Using this jump, feminists and other Libtards frequently advocate for affirmative action, transgenderism or encouraging women to enter male dominated fields.

For example, here is a link to an article by a prominent feminist website championing affirmative action for women: https://everydayfeminism.com/2015/08/affirmative-action-isnt-racist/.

Here is another source showing a feminist arguing that sexism is responsible for lack of female STEM workers in India:
https://sciencenode.org/feature/women-technology-and-feminism-reflections-india.php

Here, a popular feminist writer argues that men and women were born equal so gender differences must be the fault of nurture:
https://www.quora.com/Why-do-feminists-seek-equality-between-men-and-women

However, evidence reveals that reality is very different from what feminists believe. Men and women not only differ by nature at birth but also throughout their later lives.

In one study(https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/16/us/men-and-women-use-brain-differently-study-discovers.html) , female brains were shown to INNATELY process words differently from men’s. While previous studies had used subjective Q&A, this study proves that the differences are inherent by studying the brain in motion. This research utilized newly developed technology to scan the brains of both genders as they read. Apparently, men were shown to primarily use a small area at the front of the left hemisphere while women either also rely on their right hemisphere or do not rely on this area at all. This is particularly significant since it was found mainly by female researchers, likely feminists, who did not expect to uncover any differences between the sexes.

IQ Distribution also suggests differences between genders. This time, the proof is present in the form of graphical data followed by a very logical conclusion. While the average IQ score of both genders seems similar, there are clearly higher proportions of men with abnormal IQs than women:





(Source: https://www.quora.com/Who-usually-has-a-higher-IQ-the-male-or-the-female)

At first glance this distribution may appear arbitrary. After all, if sexism and society were to blame for differences in thinking, what would be the cause of this distribution? Fortunately, biology and an evolutionary way of thinking offer a simple explanation. Men only have a single X chromosome while women have two. This means that genetic deviance is more common in men than it is in women. Lately, it has been shown that genes play a fundamental part in determining one’s intelligence. Thus, since men are more prone to genetic deviance, they are also more likely to have deviations in their intelligence. Therefore, intelligent men are in general smarter than intelligent women which is why they are in demanding areas such as STEM and Leadership. Also, enlightenment and self-awareness are very rare in today’s world. If women tend to have average intelligence, then they are thus less likely to be self-aware or interesting.

Further, studies show that Foids’ brains have vastly different placement of white and gray matter. White matter improves communication between different parts of the brain while gray matter is where the actual processing takes place. Thus, it is not surprising that men almost always have the most gray matter. In men, gray matter appears primarily located in the left and center of the brain which explains our logic, depth of thought and ability to reason with accuracy. What little gray matter women have is primarily in the right hemisphere, the half generally more responsible for instinct and emotion.




(Source: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/01/050121100142.htm)

While IQ can change throughout one’s life, the only likely explanation is evolutionary. Further, since creation and reorganization of neurons is limited after infancy, the other structural dissimilarities must be static. Thus, there are fundamental differences between the brains of men and women starting at birth.

 Conclusion:

Clearly, feminists are wrong about gender equality. Women will likely never be like men because the two sexes have fundamentally divergent structures of thinking. Thus, it is foolish to blame female job preferences, lack of attendance at prestigious universities or choices of mates on nurture. Certainly, women are not just responding to sexism when they spend their time in the kitchen or choose to major in foreign language instead of engineering. The Blackpill tends to consist of static facts with little hope of change. This provides proof that female nature may be one of those facts, an assumption that has been long present on this forum."

Even asexuals are sexual beings who fuck and jerk off and have fantasies.,JFL,Edmund_Kemper,"Mar 8, 2022",17000,116,"Even asexuals are sexual beings. they're frauds.

In a study of asexuals and other groups of people, they found many asexuals masturbate at least monthly (55%) and 60% have had sexual fantasy before. And only 11% said their sexual fantasies did NOT involve other people.

According to Sexual fantasy and masturbation among asexual individuals: An in-depth exploration:




On average, asexual women masturbate less frequently than do sexual women; the higher women score on the asexual scale, the less likely they are to masturbate.

Asexual men masturbate “at least monthly” at the same rate as sexual men (a more fine-tuned measure of masturbation frequency might tell us otherwise). Asexual women and men who masturbate did so because they felt they “had to,” not because it was particularly sexually pleasurable or fun. They might also be motivated to masturbate to relieve tension or because of procrastination, boredom, or sleeplessness.

For many asexuals, the masturbatory procedure takes place without a sexual or romantic fantasy. The focus is on physical sensations, rather than erotic images. That is, their masturbations are more motivated by physical needs (“akin to an itch needing to be scratched”) than by innate sexual desire or arousal.

The majority of asexual women (65 percent) and men (80 percent) have sexual fantasies. However, this is a significantly lower proportion than sexuals. Asexuals’ fantasies are less exciting to them than those of sexuals are to them. Asexuals as a group are more likely than sexuals to endorse the response: “My fantasies do not involve other people.” In terms of fantasy content, asexuals are less likely than sexuals to have sex scenes such as group sex, public sex, an affair, and celebrity sex, and more likely to have scenes in which they are not present, to have a self-focus, and to have fictional human characters.

There are other fantasies among asexual women that they share with sexual women, including scenes with little focus on genital contact (BDSM, sexual humiliation, fetishes) and scenes that don’t involve others (masturbation, voyeurism, use of sex toys). If an asexual woman is in a relationship, she is less likely than a paired sexual woman to fantasize about extramarital sex.

But guess what? 70% of the asexual women masturbated at least monthly. Only 16% of asexual women and 6% of asexual men have neither masturbation nor sexual fantasy. 51% of asexual women and 75% of asexual men have both and the remainder have one of the two.

According to Williams Institute:




Asexuality is not synonymous with a lack of sexual attraction, sexual behavior, or intimate relationships. A little more than a third of asexuals reported being sexually attracted; more than half of them reported having had sex; and they were as likely to report that they were in a romantic intimate relationship (59% compared with 61% of non-asexual LGB people).


Click to expand...


According to Kinsey Institute in a study of 1,093 adults identifying as on the asexual spectrum, 69% were asexual, 16% were graysexual, and 14% were demisexual:



When it came to sexual history, 98% of asexuals and graysexuals and 100% of demisexuals said they had previously engaged in a behavior that they personally counted as having had sex. However, when looking at specific sexual behaviors they had participated in, there was a lot of variability across groups.

Click to expand...





For example, among asexuals, 33% had received oral sex, 28% had engaged in penile-vaginal intercourse, and 10% had engaged in penile-anal intercourse. The corresponding numbers for graysexuals were about twice as high and, for demisexuals were almost three times as high.

Click to expand...





Despite almost everyone in the study reported that they’ve had sex in some form or another, most reported that they weren’t interested in engaging in sex in the future. In fact, just 4% of asexuals and graysexuals and 11.5% of demisexuals reported interest.

There was only one behavior on the list that a majority of persons of all identities (>70%) said they were interested in doing in the future: cuddling. However, this is probably because cuddling is a behavior that very few people of any identity actually classified as “having sex.”

That said, graysexuals and demisexuals reported more willingness to engage in genital sexual behaviors in the future compared to asexuals. In other words, despite not having a lot of interest in sexual activity, many people on the ace spectrum still reported a willingness or openness to having sex under certain circumstances.

What are those circumstances? Overall, 37% of participants said they would be willing to have sex in the future if they felt an emotional connection to a partner. However, demisexuals (69%) were much more likely to report this motivation compared to graysexuals (40%) and asexuals (30%).

Similarly, 31% said they would be willing to have sex in the future if it was something their partner wanted. This included the desire to please a partner, even if engaging in the activity wasn’t something they personally wanted. Asexuals, graysexuals, and demisexuals were about equally likely to report this motive.

Lastly, 34% of participants said they were unlikely to engage in any sexual behaviors in the future due to disinterest or disgust. However, asexuals (42%) were more likely to say this than were graysexuals (19%) and demisexuals (10%).

Click to expand...

So this means 58% of those sex-having asexuals will still plan to fuck in the future under certain circumstances.

THIS is the root cause of inceldom (and it's IMPOSSIBLE to fix),Blackpill,proudweeb,"Dec 10, 2022",10000,101,"Let's look at some of the symptoms of our inceldom and trace back the root cause for each.

1. Social media & online dating has resulted in most women pursuing a small number of high SMV males. But where did social media originate? The internet, which came from computers, which came from microprocessors, which came from transistors, etc. Essentially, social media traces its roots back through the development of technology.

2. Prior to the internet and social media, cable television and movies led women to greater awareness that Chad-tier men were out there, and created the misguided idea that a becky-tier woman should be treated like a ""princess"" by society. Same thing - these developed from technology such as the vacuum tube, wireless transmitter, film, etc

3. Religion used to be a powerful cope that kept sluts in check, prevented divorce etc. If they were promiscuous or cheated, they'd be going straight to hell. However, religious belief has been falling for decades. Why? It's a result of our greater scientific knowledge of how the world works, and the technology that led to those discoveries. Technology such as TV, the internet etc. also brought this knowledge to the masses. Note this also applies to us men as well - we've realized that the ""rules"" in religious texts are largely bluepilled bullshit, so why should we comply and get screwed over by society? Thus, many of us have stopped pursuing marriage, a family life, etc.

4. Women going to college more and entering the workforce - Everyone has been told for decades that a college degree is the key to success. Boomer advice nowadays, but most normtards have followed it. But why would you need a degree anyway? Because the world around us is getting more complex and technologically dependent - thus, more training needed for gainful employment to work on such advanced systems. This leads to the inevitable results of college educating foids - they delay marriage and childbirth for a decade to work on their careers. Plus, they refuse to date lower income or less educated men.

5. Our hormone levels are messed up. Why? Estrogen-seeping plastics, bioengineered and manipulated trash foods, etc. This ruines our growth and development from ages 10 to 30, making us shorter and less attractive, and lowering our SMV. This too all originated from technology.

6. Our lifestyles tend to be more sedentary, since we have the internet, game consoles, etc. Jobs too are more desk-oriented rather than labor. Boomer and earlier generations were more involved with sports and blue collar jobs simply because that's all they had and knew at the time. As in item #5, this led to better health outcomes and thus higher SMV.

tl;dr the technological advancement of the last 60 years is the root cause of inceldom. It's true that foids are hypergamous by nature - however, that's always been the case. Technology just gave them the tools and knowledge to act on those instincts.

Unfortunately I see no way we could turn back the clock on technology. Ludditism, when tried throughout history, has always failed."
Women gain sexual pleasure from the pain that is inflicted upon them.,Brutal,epillepsy,"Oct 30, 2020",105000,338,"IMPORTANT INFORMATION

1. Introduction






Joan of Arc at the Coronation of Charles VII (1854), Jean Auguste Dominque Ingres.

Joan of Arc (1412-31) was an historical foid who lived during the Hundred Years’ War, a great conflict between France and England.

Born in the peaceful French village of Domrémy, Joan suffered from schizophrenic delusions since early childhood. At the age 17, she hallucinated that an evil spirit was instructing her to lead France’s army to victory over the English. She was so insistent about this that she was granted an audience with the royal court. Upon hearing her prophecy, the imbecilic King of France, Dauphin Charles VII, took her at her word and placed her in command of a battalion of soldiers.

Joan’s first military campaigns were successful. In 1429, Joan and her soldiers relieved the besieged French at the Siege of Orleans, earning her the title of “The Maid of Orleans.” In May, 1430, however, her fortunes changed dramatically and she was routed and captured by the English in Compiègne. After a short trial, she was sentenced to death by burning at for the crime of witchcraft.

Thousands of people witnessed Joan’s execution, and many accounts of her death survive to this day. As she burned at the stake, the following signs were observed:

1. Her muscles contracted and tensed up.
2. Her breasts became full and began to heave violently.
3. She cast her eyes up to heaven, and her expression was not one of pain, but something approaching spiritual ecstasy.
4, In the instant before she lost consciousness, Joan moaned out Jesus’s name three times, loud enough to be heard over the roar of the flames.
5. Joan’s vagina, in contrast to the dry kindling that burned around her, became lubricated and wet.





Individually, each of these signs do not point to a clear conclusion. But taken together, they indicate an undeniable certainty: as the flames enfolded and consumed her body, Joan of Arc was caught within the grips of a powerful orgasm.


2. Masochism

Masochism is defined as “the condition of experiencing recurring and intense sexual arousal in response to enduring moderate or extreme pain, suffering, or humiliation.” It’s described as an addiction-like tendency, with features resembling drug addiction: craving, intoxication, tolerance, and withdrawal.

Masochism is seen as aberrant in males and treated as a harmful psychological disorder.

Female masochism, on the other hand, does not suffer from the same stigma, given its ubiquity.




“Masochism is more prevalent among women than men. [...] Such things as beating fantasies and self-punishment are phenomena that seem to be more common among women than among men.''
- Dr. Eleanor Galenson, Professor of Psychiatry at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine

Click to expand...


Confirming this, In Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality (1924), Sigmund Freud described the three essential traits of femininity -- narcissism, passivity, and masochism. To Freud, pain was an inseparable part of the intensity of a woman’s sexual pleasure, “an expression of the feminine being nature.” He found in women a persistent need for punishment and humiliation, ""which succeed [...] in binding erotically the destructive trends which have been diverted inwards.""

There are numerous examples of masochism in females:

A. Women overwhelmingly prefer larger-than-average penises.

Here are some quotes from a VICE article:




Alicia is immensely turned on by dick-related pain during the act itself. “I enjoy pain during sex, so I do really like that initial pain of a huge cock smashing my cervix,” Alicia explains. The first time she felt a dick hit her cervix, she was super turned on and already past the point where pain feels painful. “I normally orgasm fairly easily, but this was something else,” she recounts. “My legs were shaking, and after we were done my legs were weak for quite a while. So, intense orgasms were achieved, with seemingly much less effort on his part compared to what I've experienced with smaller partners.”

This feeling is shared by Hanna, who thrives on the challenge of being able to take a massive member. “It gives me a strange sense of pride. I love the feeling of being totally stretched out and the reminder the next day if I'm sore.”

Click to expand...










We Spoke to Size Queens About Why They Prefer Big Dicks


“It gives me a strange sense of pride. I love the feeling of being totally stretched out.”




www.vice.com





The top selling dildos on the internet are eight to nine inches long. In the absence of a large cock, some women resort to bestiality with dogs and horses, animals with large cocks.

However, a penis of this size inflicts injuries and perforations on the vagina and causes lasting damage in the form of tears in the cervix, as well as dilation of the vaginal opening. Infections can occur, and there are several case reports of pelvic abscess and subsequent scarring due to insertion of large objects into the vagina.

B. Women love anal sex, despite the lack of an erogenous zone there.

Homosexual men also engage in anal sex. But keep in mind that gay men have erogenous zones deep within their ani known as prostate glands. Women lack this, and so in theory anal sex should be not pleasurable for them, and instead extremely painful. Nevertheless, women engage in sodomy for pastime.




94 percent of women who received anal sex in their last encounter said they reached orgasm-a higher rate of orgasm than was reported by women who had vaginal intercourse or received oral sex.

Why Do Women Who Have Anal Sex Get More Orgasms?


94 percent of women who received anal sex in their last encounter said they reached orgasm.




slate.com













This is the best way to give a woman an orgasm


Surprisingly, not oral.




metro.co.uk





Repeated anal sex (especially with the oversized penises women prefer) can harm the sphincter and rectum, leading to rectal prolapse and leakage/loose stools.

C. One reason women seek out and stay with attractive abusive men because they enjoy being beaten up.

Women seek out abusive (attractive) partners and stay with men who regularly beat them. In addition to psychological reasons, this is because the pain of getting physically assaulted turns them on. In fact, many women report having had the best sex of their lives immediately following such an “abusive episode.”

Studies on this phenomenon are suppressed and hidden by Google’s search algorithm.

D. Women engage in various paraphilias, including “knife play.”

Angelina Jolie reported that she could not reach orgasm during sex without being cut with a knife.






Angelina Jolie reveals her dark sexual exploits


Mother of four Angelina Jolie has spoken openly about her dark sexual past. The Hollywood heavyweight says she used a knife to cut herself and her early boyfriend, after losing her virginity at 14




www.dailymail.co.uk





Here, the actress is referring to a variation of “knife play,” a common fetish among women in which a sharp knife is inserted carefully into the vagina, causing targeted lacerations in the walls of the cervix and sending waves of sexual pleasure surging through the woman’s body.

***

In each of the above examples, harmful stimuli that should be perceived as dysphoric are misinterpreted by the female brain as euphoric; women feel pain as pleasure, even when their bodies are placed at harm’s risk.

From this, we can conclude there is a maladaptive mechanism in the female brain whereby pain is transformed into its polar opposite pleasure. Psychological aspects to this masochism exist as well, but the basis of this pleasure is neurological.

3. Counterpoint

Despite this, many studies deny the existence of this innate masochism in females, some even claiming that women suffer more pain than men.

Here is one such study:








Gender differences in pain ratings and pupil reactions to painful pressure stimuli - PubMed


In order to investigate gender differences in pain perception, the present study employed both a psychophysical and a psychophysiological measure. In experiment 1, 20 subjects rated the painfulness of 4 different levels of tonic pressure applied to their fingers using a verbally anchored...




pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov





In this study, an equal number of men and women were exposed to painful electrical stimuli of controlled strength.
Pupillary dilation was measured in both groups, and each participant was asked to rate on a decile scale how much pain they felt.

The female group presented with more pupillary dilation than the male group, and rated their pain higher than the men did. From this, the researchers concluded that women felt more pain than men.

But there are two obvious flaws with this methodology.

First, measuring pupillary dilation to quantify perceived pain is unreliable, since pupils dilate in response to both pain and pleasure. The dilation itself does not signify that specifically pain or pleasure is being felt, only that one of the two are. Naturally, the researchers assumed that the pupils dilated due to pain, but logically, pleasure cannot be ruled out.

Pupils also dilate in response to any strong emotion.

The second, and more detrimental, flaw was in asking the subjects to rate their pain themselves.

As researchers at UCLA (Toomey, et al) pointed out:



Women may report more pain than men due to social conditioning and gender expectations. Gender roles permit girls to be emotional and express pain openly, whereas boys are expected to be brave and stoic and keep a stiff upper lip.

Click to expand...


Asking subjects to rate their own pain runs into the same problem as the studies that compare the number of sex partners between men and women. In that case, men exaggerated their true number, while women minimized theirs. Here, we can be sure that the opposite will be the case. Women will pretend to feel great pain because of hypochondria and victim complex, whereas men will attempt to appear masculine by deliberately minimizing the amount of pain they feel.

Because of these flaws in methodology, the only valid conclusion we can derive from this study is that, when it comes to injury, women complain more than men.

***

A second argument is that women feel more pain than men due to having more nerves.









Ouch! Why Women Feel More Pain


Women have twice as many pain receptors as men.




www.livescience.com





This argument also fails to convince.

Since my thesis is that pain is felt as pleasure to women, the more nerves a person has, the more able she is to feel not only pain, but also the concomitant pleasure. Increased nerve density increases potentiality of pleasure as well as pain. And if during a given pain event the pleasure overcrowds the pain, that intermingled feeling can’t be said to be pain at all, but pleasure, mathematically speaking. In a linear sense, pain you want to repeat over and over again due to the pleasure you get from it can’t be called pain. It's similar to the pleasure of repeatedly scratching a mosquito bite or bearing down on an aching tooth.

I. Men experience pain in the analytical regions of the brain, whereas women experience “pain” in the emotional regions.

Here, researchers applied heat stimulations to the forearms of an equal number of male and female volunteers, while monitoring their brains using positron emission tomography (PET) scans.
The PET scans measured increases in blood flow and cerebral activation patterns during pain perception.

After analyzing the results, they concluded that “the cognitive, or analytic, region of the male brain lights up, while the female limbic system, the brain's emotional headquarters, springs into action.”









Do men and women feel pain differently?


Studies show that women are more sensitive to pain than men, despite their bodies' ability to withstand the agony of childbirth. Does social conditioning help men keep a stiff upper lip when they're hurt? Or do emotions and estrogen factor into this painful equation?




science.howstuffworks.com





Specifically, males had a larger magnitude of opioid receptor activation in the following areas:
1. Anterior thalamus
2. Hypothalamus
3. Ventral basal ganglia

While females had far more opioid receptor activation in the limbic system, comprised of:
1. Amygdala
2. Hypocampus
3. Thalamus

As in the previous study, the researchers noted that “the females verbally perceived the 50°C heat stimulus as more intense compared with males.”

The authors speculated that, because pain causes an emotionally charged limbic response in women, that may be responsible for the greater
complaining from the women. In other words, women felt “offended” by this pain, as if it were a social faux pas, and reacted similarly to it as if they had been hurt psychologically, rather than physically.



Spoiler: Source



The authors assimilated this difference with greater activation in the thalamus, anterior insula, and contralateral prefrontal cortex of females as evidenced by the PET scan. The difference found within the prefrontal cortex may be responsible for the affective, or psychological, differences seen between genders in pain perception.



Even a foid scientist agrees:




""Pain is inherently subjective,"" says Jennifer Graham. ""We typically rely on self-report to know if someone is experiencing it."" And it's tough to determine how much of pain is sensory and how much is influenced by psychological factors, she adds. ""The limbic system of the brain, which is related to emotion, is typically active in response to physical pain for both men and women. In fact, looking at functional MRI, it can be difficult to distinguish psychological pain-such as that caused by social exclusion-from pain that is purely physical.""

Gender Differences In Brain Response To Pain


A new UCLA study shows that different parts of the brain are stimulated in reaction to pain depending on gender. The research, which represents the largest gender-comparison study of its kind, focused on people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), one of the nation's most common chronic medical...



www.sciencedaily.com





According to Graham, nociceptive pain sensed in the limbic system (as it is in women) cannot be differentiated from psychological pain when examined through current medical technology.

Thus, increased activity in the limbic system in response to physical pain stimuli does not necessarily indicate a felt non-psychological pain.
This further suggests that, for women (but not men), physical pain is almost indistinguishable from social, psychological pain, such as being excluded, offended, outraged, or sad.

A woman, unable to distinguish between emotional and physical pain except through first causes, evidently wouldn’t be able to understand the distinction, no more than a blind man can comprehend the concept of vision.


II. Pain response is “mu-dominant” in females, while it is “kappa-dominant” in males.

When a nerve ending detects a painful stimulus, it sends a signal to the central nervous system, where the body produces calming and pain-relieving hormones called endorphins.

Endorphins (contracted from endogenous morphine) are a opioid-like substance similar to fentanyl that reduces pain in response to painful stimuli. Endorphins are “caught” by different opioid receptors in various parts of the brain, and produce varying effects depending on the type of opioid receptor they are caught by.

There are three different types of opioid receptors: mu, kappa, and delta.
Mu and kappas are the two most significant receptors; delta receptors have minimal effect in alleviating nociceptive pain.
Binding sites for the three receptors overlap in many brain structures, but some structures exhibit higher expression of one receptor over the others.

Here are some “brain maps” that show where mu- and kappa-opioid receptors are found in the brain.

As you can see, mu-opioid receptors are more prevalent in the limbic system, whereas kappa-opioid receptors predominate in the cognitive centers of the brain.

Specifically:
Mu is the most expressed opioid receptor in the amygdala, thalamus, mesencephalon and some brain stem nuclei. (1)
In a few structures, only one receptor type is detected: mu binding sites only are detected in four thalamic nuclei (lateral geniculate thalamus, ventrolateral thalamus, ventromedial thalamus, and posterior thalamus), the sensory trigeminal nucleus (SNT) and nucleus ambiguus (Amb).

Kappa is the most represented receptor in the basal anterior forebrain, including the claustrum (Cl) and endopiriform cortex (En), olfactory tubercle (Tu), striatum (caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens), preoptic area (POA), hypothalamus, and pituitary.
Kappa binding sites only are found in seven brain regions that are part of the stress axis (Cl, paraventricular hypothalamus, arcuate nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, Me, CeA, and pituitary).

A Yale study similarly found mu-opioid dominance in females and kappa-receptor dominance in males.

Males had significantly higher V T and thus a higher KOR (kappa opioid receptor) availability than women in multiple brain regions.

Mu-opioid dominance is also confirmed by better reaction from females to mu-opioid-specific drugs than men. Women required 40% less morphine (a mu-opioid-specific medicine) than men for post-operative, reardless of body weight or diffusion of the drug in the body.
Women also seem to get much greater pain relief from mixed-action opioid medications and experience greater pain relief with mu-specific opioids.
Based on these findings, researchers concluded that that mu-opioid receptor (MOR) binding density would be higher in females than in males.

In addition, the idea that males and females respond differently to opioids is not new, but until recently the difference was believed to be limited to potency, with clinical studies showing that women require less morphine for post-operative pain than men.
(4) Research by Craft found that women use 40% less opioid-based medicine than men for postoperative pain.10 This finding was confirmed by Miaskowski et al in an analysis of 18 studies of postoperative opioid use.
Several studies of pain after oral surgery revealed that women get much greater pain relief from mixed-action opioid medications (eg, pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol).12 More recently, a meta-analysis of this literature confirmed that women seem to experience greater pain relief with opioids.
In their study, the researchers also discovered that female rats received significantly more pain relief when mu opioid was injected into the vlPAG than male rats, a fact that was not attributable to body weight or diffusion of the drug in the body.
***
Moreover, men are more likely than women to engage in substance abuse (Lynch et al. 2002), while women become addicted to opiates more quickly following first use (Lex 1991; Roth et al. 2004). Similarly, female rats acquired heroin self-administration more quickly than their male counterparts, and subsequently, self-administered larger amounts of the drug (Lynch and Carroll 1999; Cicero et al. 2003). It is plausible that sex differences in MOR activation underlie sex differences in these behaviors. In support, PET scan studies revealed higher MOR binding in several brain regions of women compared to men (Zubieta et al. 1999). Likewise, higher MOR binding density was found in several brain regions in female rats compared to males, although these rats were gonadectomized (Vathy et al. 2003). However, it remains unknown whether sex differences are present in the intact rat brain and whether these sex differences emerge early in development. Therefore, our second aim was to compare MOR binding density between intact male and female rats at both juvenile and adult ages. Based on these previous findings in humans and gonadectomized adult rats (Zubieta et al. 1999; Vathy et al. 2003), we hypothesized that MOR binding density would be higher in females than in males.



III. Mu are the rewarding receptors, while kappa are the punishing receptors.

Mu and kappa receptors both serve a role in mediating nociceptive pain, but do so in different ways. To put it simply, mu-opioid receptors “reward” pain, whereas kappa receptors “punish” it.

The functional response of mu- and kappa-opioid receptors can be replicated through the administration of mu-specific or kappa-specific drugs. The pain response of opioid receptors can be emulated to a greater or lesser extent by administering these drugs and observing their effects.
In other words, the effects caused by theses receptor-specific agonists are the same (differering only in degree) as the “natural” response to pain caused by non-artificial means of activation (i.e. actual pain stimuli, rather than induced activation).


A. Mu Receptors

The areas in which mu-opioid receptors are most prevalent (the limbic system, the primary regions in which females register pain) are known informally as “hedonistic hotspots.” These areas of the brain play a large role in the reinforcement of pleasure. Overactivation of this area are drug addiction, food addiction, etc.
These receptors contribute to the reinforcing properties of most drugs of abuse.
Stimulation of mu opioid receptors generates an increase in both “liking” and “wanting” for reward.
Thus, mu-opioid receptors induce relaxation, trust, satisfaction and have a strong analgesic effect.

Morphine is a powerful pain relieving drug that produces euphoria. It is mu-opioid specific, meaning it acts on and targets the mu-opioid receptors. Other mu-specific drugs include heroin and fentanyl. Most opioid drugs of abuse fall under this category.
The effects of morphine include euphoria, mood lift, relaxation, and analgesia.




Spoiler: Source



Relevant to drug intake, genetic data demonstrate that mu receptors contribute to the reinforcing properties of most drugs of abuse, [...]
The opioid system, which mediates hedonic evaluation of natural rewards, represents another key substrate for the deleterious effects of drugs of abuse. Indeed, the reinforcing properties of many abused drugs depend on the activation of mu opioid receptors
which thus may be a potential molecular gateway to drug addiction (72).
Conversely, mu and delta antagonists [medications which inhibit the effect of these receptors] suppress the positive reinforcing properties of natural rewards and opiate or nonopioid drugs, whereas kappa receptors induce dysphoria and counteract mu receptors in regulating hedonic homeostasis. (2)

B. Kappa Receptors

Kappa is generally known to be a dysphoric, aversive receptor in terms of its pain-mediating effects.

While systemic mu agonists (morphine, heroin, etc) produce positive reinforcement, kappa agonists induce aversion, hallucinations, and malaise, producing anxiety, fear, and depression.
Furthermore, activation of kappa receptors counteract the reward processes of the mu-receptors, and in male models, increases psychological discomfort associated with pain.

Because of these dysphoric effects, no kappa-specific drug is in wide use today, either as anaesthesia or recreationally. Mixed-action opioids, however, such as nalbuphine, have been used on women to some success, although they are ineffective in men (See Section IV).

Kappa receptors are the “punishing” receptors.
It is believed that kappa-opioid receptors exist to produce avoidance behaviors in response to pain, causing extreme negative feelings to be associated with the source of the pain, so that the brain can learn to avoid similar sources of pain in the future.



Spoiler: Source



Pharmacological studies have long shown that kappa receptor activation is aversive in animal models.
Globally systemic mu agonists produce positive reinforcement, whereas kappa agonists induce aversion, hallucinations, and malaise.
Kappa receptors also counteract reward processes under stressful conditions.

Traditionally, kappa-opioids have been dismissed as ineffective analgesics in humans.
Nalbuphine, which is often used to anesthetize women during childbirth, does little to mitigate pain in men.

Kappa receptors induce dysphoria and counteract mu receptors in regulating hedonic homeostasis. (2)

KOR agonists produce signs of anxiety, fear, and depression in laboratory animals and humans, findings that have led to the hypothesis that drug withdrawal-induced DYN release is instrumental in negative reinforcement processes that drive addiction.

In short, MOR (mu-opioid receptors) produce a euphoric effect in response to pain, similar to that of fentanyl, heroin, or morphine.
KOR (kappa-opioid receptors), however, produce a dysphoric effect, causes psychological discomfort, anxiety, fear, and depression.

IV. Kappa receptors work synergistically with mu receptors in females, increasing the “rewarding” effect. In contrast, the two receptors work at cross purposes in males; kappa decreases the effect of mu receptors in men, thereby increasing the “punishing” effect.

In Section III, it has been established that kappa receptors are punishing and dysphoric. New studies have suggested, however, that the negative effects of KOR activation seems to only be present in males. In females, kappa receptor activation appears to have a synergistic effect with mu-opioid receptors, making the “rewarding” aspects of it more powerful.

Because kappa-opioids had mostly been tested on male subjects, on whom kappa activation results in dysophoria and great mental distress, medical professionals traditionally have dismissed kappa-opioids as viable analgesics in humans.

However, UCSF scientists recently performed a study about the analgesic effects of kappa agonists, this time on human female subjects.
They undertook this after a previous study discovered that kappa-opioids brought pain relief to female rats but not male rats.

They found that in women, a drug made up of a strong concentration of kappa-opioid has a strong and lasting analgesic effect.
In contrast, in men, the low dose actually increased pain; as the dose was increased, the heightened pain disappeared and a weak, short-lived analgesic effect set in.

In their previous study on rats, the Fields team showed that treating the vlPAG neurons of male rats with a mu opioid brought about pain relief, but that subsequently adding kappa-opioid into the RVM markedly decreased the mu opioid’s analgesic effect.
In males, KOR worked to sabotage MOR in a sense, and decreased the rewards of mu.

However, Treating the vlPAG neurons of female rats with a mu opioid brought on the expected pain relief, but subsequently adding kappa-opioid into the RVM increased the mu opioid’s analgesic effect.

Traditionally, kappa-opioids have been dismissed as ineffective analgesics in humans.
While the majority of sex difference findings related to KOR are from studies of the analgesic effects of kappa agonists, there is also emerging evidence of KOR-related sex differences in addictive and affective states [6].
This led them to reexamine the posibility of using kappa-opioids as analgesics, only in human females.
Researchers led by UCSF scientists are reporting that an experimental pain drug known as a kappa-opioid brings pain relief to female rats but not males, a finding that adds weight to a recent UCSF clinical finding, and highlights, they say, the need to evaluate drugs by gender.
Fields’ finding-that specific brain regions in male and female rats have opposite reactions to kappa-opioids, supporting clinical studies at UCSF that indicate kappa-opioids are more effective in women for clinically significant pain.
A clinical study led by UCSF professor Jon Levine, MD, PhD showed that, in women, a drug made up of a strong concentration of kappa-opioid has a strong and lasting analgesic effect.
In contrast, in men, the low dose actually increased pain; as the dose was increased, the heightened pain disappeared and a weak, short-lived analgesic effect set in.
The discovery, he says, demonstrates a clear biological difference in the way women and men respond to kappa-opioids.
Three years ago, the Fields team showed that treating the vlPAG neurons of male rats with a mu opioid brought about pain relief, but that subsequently adding kappa-opioid into the RVM markedly decreased the mu opioid’s analgesic effect.
Treating the vlPAG neurons of female rats with a mu opioid brought on the expected pain relief, but subsequently adding kappa-opioid into the RVM increased the mu opioid’s analgesic effect.
“In males, kappa-opioid is somehow inhibiting the actions of mu-opioid,” says Fields.
Kappa receptors are acting on opposite types of neurons in males and females. In males, kappas may be inhibiting the so-called “off” nerve cells in the RVM that normally tell the spinal cord to shut off pain signals. In females, kappa-opioids actually excite the off neurons, which would relieve pain.

In men, however:
The functionality of kappa- and delta-opioid receptors, might be less associated with relaxation and analgesic effects as kappa-OR often suppress activation of mu-opioid receptors, and delta-OR differ from mu-OR in its interaction with agonists and antagonists.

What these studies show is that mu- and kappa-opioid receptors work at cross-purposes in males, decreasing the rewarding effects of mu receptors.
However, the two receptors work synergistically in females; kappa activation increases the rewarding effects of mu receptors.

V. Estrogen is a natural painkiller that modulates opioid receptors to be more effective.

Estrogen is present in women at a level that is 10 to 15 times higher than the level present in men.

In 2011, researchers (Stenning et al) discovered that estrogen can modulate the density of opioid receptors.

Estrogen have also been found to induce mu-opioid receptor activation within the preoptic nucleus and posterodorsal medial amygdaloid nucleus.

High densities of estrogen receptors functionally related to endorphin receptors have been found within the hypothalamus, one of the primary sites of MOR. [mu-opioid receptors]

In addition, research on sex hormones indicates there is improved mu receptor binding in some brain regions in women after they receive estrogen, as measured by PET scans.
One of the conclusions forwarded from this research is that a decrease in estrogen would increase sensitivity to pain. Conversely, an increase in estrogen would promote analgesic effect by stimulating a bolus of pain-inhibiting transmitters.

The effects of estrogen modulation of pain receptors is further confirmed in a study by Dr. Kern Olson.
According to him:
Girls and boys react to pain in a similar fashion before puberty but differently after puberty; these differences, however, decrease as levels of sex hormones decrease as people age. (i.e., after menopause, when estrogen levels in women plummet)

Aside from their function in reproduction, sex hormones and their receptors that are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system have
demonstrated modulatory effects on the central opioid system to responses in pain.

Estrogen have also been found to induce mu-opioid receptor activation within the preoptic nucleus and posterodorsal medial amygdaloid nucleus.

High densities of estrogen receptors functionally related to endorphin receptors have been found within the hypothalamus, an area

On a study on rats, an injection of mu-specific opioid drugs into the brains of male rats were seen to suppress male gonadal function. In other words, the rats were unable to maintain an erection after being administered these drugs, and mating behaviors decreased in response.

However, in female rats, administration of mu-specific drugs did not correlate with symptoms of sexual dysfunction.
On the contrary, when mu-opioids were administrated to female rats only in a group, unpaced mating increased. This nymphomania was increased the closer the rats got to estrus, corresponding with higher levels of estrogen. This was associated to higher rates of mu activation, which suggests a certain threshold of pain must be reached before sexual arousal happens.
This suggests that the pro-sexual effect of MOR activation on females will increase when estrogen levels are higher, such as during estrus, certain phases of the menstrual cycle, and the later terms of pregnancy.

The researchers reported that with lower levels of estrogen, progesterone was pronociceptive.
Thresholds were decreased, and pain intensities increased during the midluteal phase when progesterone levels were relatively higher than estrogen levels.

[19] This system is also thought to be important in mediating complex social behaviors involved in the formation of stable, emotionally committed relationships. Social attachment was demonstrated to be mediated by the opioid system through experiments administering morphine and naltrexone, an opioid agonist and antagonist, to juvenile guinea pigs. The agonist decreased the preference of the juvenile to be near the mother and reduced distress vocalization whereas the antagonist had the opposite effects. Experiments were corroborated in dogs, chicks, and rats confirming the evolutionary importance of opioid signaling in these behaviors.
[18] Researchers have also found that systemic naltrexone treatment of female prairie voles during initial exposure to a male reduced subsequent mating bouts and nonsexual socialization with this familiar partner, when a choice test including a novel male was performed afterwards. This points to a role for opioid receptors in mating behaviors.

This pro-sexual phenomenon can be observed in human females as well. Estrogen serves to increase the feelings of sexual arousal derived from pain.

This effect can be seen in the “birthgasm.” During pregnancy, the estrogen levels in a women increase the closer she gets to giving birth. This effect is seen during pregnancy and may account for pregnancy-induced increases in tolerance to nociception. This may have evolved so that a woman could better tolerate the “pain” of childbirth. As a result, a woman’s estrogen levels are necessarily highest just before and during the act of giving birth. Estrogen and MOR activation working in tandem have often resulted in women having orgasms during childbirth:

When a woman feels the contractions of an orgasm and/or extreme moments of pleasure right at the moment of delivering her baby, this may be called an “orgasmic birth.” You may feel tremendous pressure and sensation in the vagina as your baby's birth approaches, then a powerful, pleasurable release that's both physical and orgasmic.

This phenomenon is common enough that the term of “birthgasm” was coined.

5. Acupuncture

Acupuncture was a saving grace. It helps more than anything else I tried.

Acupuncture is a form of alternate medicine in which thin needles are inserted into the body. The practice of acupuncture is considered a pseudoscience because the theories and practices of traditional Chinese medicine -- based on the concepts of qu, meridians, and acupuncture points, life force energy -- are not amenable to modern scientific knowledge, and it has been characterized as quackery.
Many scientific reviews have found that acupuncture is ineffective for a wide range of conditions.

Some research results suggest that it can alleviate some forms of pain, though the majority of research suggests that its apparent effects are not caused by the treatment itself. Many acupunctures attribute pain relief to the release of endorphins when needles penetrate.









Acupuncture - Wikipedia

In other words, there is a prevailing theory that the way acupuncture “works” is by causing pain that causes the body to go into pain control overdrive, releasing endorphins and creating a state of well-being.

Unsurprisingly, the great majority of proponents of acupuncture are female. By some estimates, the ratio of women to men who use acupuncture regularly is 5 to 1. (This especially applies to East Asian women, who are on average more masochistic and exogamic than women of other races.) Discounting the placebo effect, the logical explanation is that acupuncture works for women, but not men.

To see why this is, let’s examine the differences of male and female brains’ reactions in response to acupuncture.

In males:
The needle is inserted.
Pain is sensed by the nerves.
A small number of rewarding mu receptors activate, and a large number of punishing kappa receptors activate.
Mu receptors try to “reward” for the pain. However, the kappa receptors lessen this effect.
Male feels pain and aversion. He begins to associate acupuncture with negative feelings of dysphoria.
The man’s sexual desire decreases, and erection becomes impossible.

In females:
The needle is inserted.
Pain is sensed by the nerves.
A large number of rewarding mu receptors activate, and a small number of synergistically rewarding kappa receptors activate.
Mu rewards the woman for the pain. Kappa helps this effect, transforming pain into pleasure.
Estrogen modulates the pain response, causing sexual arousal.
Female feels euphoria and sexual arousal. She begins to associate acupuncture with positive feelings of euphoria.
The woman’s sexual desire increases; her desire for unpaced mating goes up.

It’s not difficult to see, then, why women are the primary consumers of acupuncture.

A famous example of acupuncture working as advertised proves my point further.

In the early 20th century, surgeons performed open heart surgery on a 15-year-old girl in China without using anesthesia. The only measures taken to alleviate the pain of the surgery was acupuncture. Nevertheless, it is said that girl remained calm and immobile during the operation, which was a great success. To this day, this is held up as one of the primary pieces evidence of evidence in support of the efficacy of acupuncture.

However, notice that it was a girl who received the surgery, and not a boy. A male would scarcely have been able to endure the pain of the operation. However, it would have been no difficulty at all for a female.

6. Conclusion

Proposed Changes to Society:

1. Medication.
Opioids and anesthetics are inherently dangerous to administer to women, since there is a greater chance of overdose and addiction. (See III.A)
As a result, it would be beneficial for their safety if anesthetics were not administered during female patients’ surgeries.
Anesthesia can be replaced with acupuncture for female patients, which, as shown above (5), has comparable efficacy and far less risk.
This will also increase supply and decrease demand of anesthesia medication, leading to a decrease in the cost of expensive anesthesia procedures.

2. Abortion.
Many current proponents of abortion justify the legality of early-term abortion by the logic that the baby does not yet feel pain.
Following this logic, it would seem that crimes are more serious the more pain is caused.
But women essentially feel no physical pain, as shown above.
To maintain legal consistency, it follows that either abortion must be classed as murder, or crimes that cause bodily injury (battery and domestic assault) to women should not be punished as harshly as those which cause bodily injury to men.

3. Scientific Studies.
German scientists and physicians made great medical advances in the 1940s, due to their progressive genetic research and innovative surgical experimentation, particularly in the area of twins. This was a time of medical enlightenment, and many of the concepts they discovered are still used today. Various legislative considerations, however, prevent us from conducting similar studies today.
However, since our knowledge of the nature of human suffering was then incomplete and now we are more informed, some of these restrictions can now be loosened on experimentation on female subjects.

I switched jobs in the meantime and got into a job full of young people, good looking young women included. I actually managed to obtain a really solid social circle. I have a great job now. None of this matters.

When people talk about social circle maxxing what they're talking about is a specific kind of social circle that really only exists in movies. You're not going to get into a social circle where new women show up every once in a while. You're not in a movie, you're not a Chad, these things don't happen.
As a rule, any social outing has less women than men. I go drinking every Friday to a bar where I know at least 5 people, even if my friends didn't show up. I've been doing this for a year now. You'd think around 50 fridays worth of exposure to social contact would eventually net you some meaningful female interactions, could be purely platonic, but no. Not only is the gender ratio completely fucked, the women that DO show up there show up either in large all female groups, a pair of women, or mixed group with boyfriends. My social circle is mixed gender, women I talk to never bring their female friends. Also, they're all taken. ALL of them. I'm not even interested in them but the fact that they're all taken is infuriating. This is another theme that you start noticing when you talk to women that are 20-30.

Why does that only work on men?
The answer is two-fold

1. women have inherent value, you can't loose your woman card because being a woman is synonymous with having female flesh.
2. masculinity as its propagated by women and society largely harms men and benefits women.

According to this study, you actually need to work constantly to maintain your status as a ""real man"" - Sisyphus anyone?


https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/men-a0029826.pdf








I will now explain point 1 and 2 a bit more in detail:

1. Why do Women have more value 
a) TL;DR Water Wet, the only thing that makes a woman a woman is her looks
I don't believe in evo-psych sorry. I think it's even completely unnecessary to recount elaborate fables for certain human behaviors, when the same behaviors could simply be explained by narcissism.

Besides, the entire discussion usually slips into female-worship when you bring up evolution, because the implication that for instance ""men are disposable"" implies that all women are somehow 10/10 genetically perfect and healthy creatures, since the majority of them reproduce. So all women have perfect genes, and if we just let women reproduce with chads, everyone would be 10/10?

This is retarded and foid worship. Especially given that the fetus spends 9 months inside the foid growing, yet somehow only the males sperm is responsible for ALL the traits the child has? Again, foid worship because it leaves the females responsibility out of the equation. If anything the health and nutritional profile of the mother is WAY more important than DNA. Look into nutrition please, ""Nutrition and Physical Degeneration"" by Weston A. Price is a good starting point. Your looks are mostly shaped by factors such as maternal nutrition, breastfeeding, correct chewing, swallowing and breathing patterns etc.

Good article on the suppression of medical data showing that animal fats are good for you:








The sugar conspiracy | Ian Leslie


The Long Read: In 1972, a British scientist sounded the alarm that sugar – and not fat – was the greatest danger to our health. But his findings were ridiculed and his reputation ruined. How did the world’s top nutrition scientists get it so wrong for so long?




www.theguardian.com





Neoteny in women is also often not the result of sexual dimorphism but simply nutritional degeneration. It is just not as apparent in women because women, unlike men, profit from looking neotenous. If the genders were healthy and fully developed after being raised on the correct diet, sexual dimorphism would be reduced greatly.

""Sorry sweaty its just natural selection"" - so why does the majority of women reproduce? This is a simple logical fallacy, which, if brought to its conclusion, implies women somehow are more healthy, genetically superior and smarter than men. This is foid-worship, without a doubt.

So, I propose an alternative theory for why women are more valued, with a different starting presupposition:

1. Men respond to neoteny in any form, puppies, children, women with parental instinct (origin of instinct is debatable)
2. Women do everything in their power to exaggerate sexual dimorphism and increase neoteny (Esther Vilar wrote about this in her 1971 book ""The Manipulated Man"")
3. The mechanism (for lack of a better word) that makes men forgive women, is the same mechanism that makes men forgive a dog for shitting on the rug.

Dogs, btw, are nutritionally deficient mutants bred to look retarded and neotenous. It's literally like having a down syndrome child in your home, but on purpose. Women anyone?
3 million dog bites that need medical attention in US every year, yet nobody cares. Why? Neoteny, the dog is never blamed. If it was a hyena people would put it through meat grinder and applaud the person doing it.
It's the same mechanism that shields women from blame. It's just their looks. Stupid example to make a point: If a woman looked like a man, but acted the same, would her behavior be remotely acceptable? No, of course not -> ALWAYS genderswap in your head. Use faceapp on bitches to see what they would look like as men, then you can tell their actual nature. Some bitches look like thugs when genderswapped and their behavior always matches the looks.

So, the only thing that keeps women from getting their register pounded six days from tomorrow is their looks. Obviously.

b) INSANE female in-group bias (4.5 times the one men have, men have ZERO - study below)


https://sci-hub.ru/10.1037/0022-3514.87.4.494



Now, this one is less discussed and may come as a surprise to some here.
1. women are the only group in society that has innate in-group preference for their own gender
2. this means women naturally form a ""herd"" or ""hive""
3. women trust women; men trust women; men fight men; ->society

That means, society is only women. Men fighting to get female validation is an attempt to get BACK into society.
ALL men are viewed as and out-group by both men and women. Every man is a stranger effectively.
The only way to get away from this, is by being accepted by women. If one woman accepts you, all do and thus, you are part of society (which is only women).
That's why people always act suspicious around single males, but not around men with women.

What that means for us is that the female in-group dictates which traits men need to display to get access to their in-group. Aka, women define what masculinity is.
As always, everything women say is projection.
Femininity is a social construct, designed to encourage certain behaviors in men by negation. These behaviors are then called ""Masculinity.""

Example:
Women act weak and helpless, there for its Masculine to be strong and help women (Female hypoagency).
This is also a classic manipulation tactic. The easiest way to manipulate people is by giving them what they want, because people don't question compliments (Just world fallacy + Fundamental Attribution Error).

What they do is basically pretend to be weak so the man feels empowered in his pseudo ""masculinity"" (which is only contingent on women liking him). That makes the man feel powerful and in charge, while she is actually in power and retains plausible deniability.

In reality, women are extremely powerful. This can not be stated enough. Women are infinitely more powerful than men. Their in-group preference alone makes them unstoppable. Imagine having 50% of society unconditionally supporting you + simps worshipping you and ready to kill another man at your order.

The reason why women project that there has to be a patriarchy is because it matches their IRL experience of life.
They constantly cheat the system by getting support from other women. They are like the mafia, but its half of society + simps as their cronies.

Additionally, women control 80% of customer spending or more, depending on sector:








The Purchasing Power of Women: Statistics | Girlpower Marketing


Women control over $20 trillion in world-wide spending. Learn more about the purchasing power of women, from Millennials to Baby Boomers, in various markets




girlpowermarketing.com










This statistic alone should send shivers down your spine.
The implication here is that 40% of the money women spend comes from men, AT THE VERY LEAST.
Furthermore, women hold most of the wealth.

More studies here:


http://www.mrarchivist.com/data/



An additional study where they made men and women play an online RPG together. After some time, the women held the majority of the resources and power, while engaging in less risk taking behavior (fighting, dying, competing) -> men gave them all their resources. Even in a video game.




It is immediately clear that females accumulate significantly more wealth (H0 rejected at 4 sigma level), i.e. credits, than males. At the same time male players experience significantly more deaths (rejection at 2 sigmas), due to more risk-taking and/or aggressive behavior. This points at a much larger engagement of females in economic, rather than destructive activities

This means exactly what it sounds like.
4.5 in-group preference = women form a large, coherent hive-body with no individualism. This also makes them lesbian.
Men fuck each other. Up.
TL;DR of study:
1. women have much higher in-group bias for other women, communicate much more, have stronger networks to support each other - sisterhood mafia, women are jews
2. men kill each other but paradoxically trust women instantly and surrender all their resources to them
3. as result women are extremely empowered with both males serving them and providing them with resources while women take zero risks of their own
4. society. study link below.

That means, women are in total control of society on any level. They dictate beliefs, thoughts, how men view themselves, who gets big on social media, they dictate the entire market through their spending etc...

It all comes down to something we all are familar with: Briffaults law
Briffault's law states:



""The female, not the male, determines all the conditions of the animal family. Where the female can derive no benefit from association with the male, no such association takes place.""

Click to expand...


Now, in the light of all of the above, consider the insane power women hold in society. It's truly staggering how powerless men are.
Please think about this:
How pathetic, I can't stress this enough, HOW PATHETIC is it to tell young men to ""just go to the gym"" in the light of this?
How absolutely comical is it to make young men participate in a race this rigged?

The biggest pill is the genderpill: IF YOU ARE BORN MALE ITS OVER
That's why ""masculinity"" doesn't exist outside the context of what women want, that's why you can loose it. It's a passport to society that can be revoked by women at any time. It's a conditional surrender of your individuality and dignity in favor of women.

LASTLY: IF YOU CHASE MONEY, YOU ALSO SERVE WOMEN
If it isn't obvious at this point:

1. women control all the wealth, directly and indirectly
2. if you want to be successful in any way financially, you have to cater to women
3. by chasing money you indirectly support women by providing them services and further exploiting men
4. to chase money means to compete with other men for female validation, women don't compete like that, they support each other (4.5 in-group pref)
5. women act just like jewsh with their retarded-tier high in-group preference and nepotism. If you go along with this, you're a jew. A female with a male body would just be jew tbh.

Chasing money is a feminine trait. It's female centered, it serves females, it gets you female attention -> its feminine

There's a reason why it says in the Gospels, you can either serve God or Mammon, not both. A man can only have one master.




No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

The Study it refers to:


https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/239672/original/Alexander+%26+Fisher+%282003%29.pdf



The Articles linked in the thread:

a) Article about the original 2003 study








Fake lie-detector reveals women's sex lies


Women are less likely than men to be truthful about their sexual experiences, suggest new work that solves an old puzzle




www.newscientist.com





b) Article about the 2013 rerun of the study








Who lies more about sex, men or women?


Ever have that awkward talk with a romantic partner about your sexual history -- about how old you were when you lost your virginity and how many people you've had sex with?




www.latimes.com





Key Points to take away from the paper


Women's body count doubled when they thought they could not get away with lying (fake lie detector test)
Women reported significantly earlier age of first sexual experiences than men
Women reported more sexual partners than men in the fake lie detector test, quote:




In the bogus pipeline condition,which encouraged
honesty rather than social desirability,women actually
reported more sexual partners than did men.This pattern
should be interpreted cautiously because the overall inter-
action between participants sex and testing condition was
not significant.Nonetheless the trend is intriguing and
may help explain why hetero sexual males report a greater
number of sexual partners than do hetero sexual females
(Wiederman,1997)

Click to expand...


This is important because obviously when ever a guys has sex with a woman, the gender ratio is 50/50.
So we would expect equal amounts of partners between men and women. The researchers struggled with this question, since men report more partners and women less.
Women reporting more partners just flips the problem.
Of course we know the answer now.

Also, notice in the quote how they make excuses for the women, since the finding contradicts the image of the pure female:
""This pattern should be interpreted cautiously because the overall interaction between participants sex and testing condition was not significant.""

This goes hand in hand with something @WorthlessSlavicShit has pointed out to me in this thread:









Misandry, Not Misogyny, is Rampant in Society (Study)


Analysis finds that across the board, there is pro-female bias in society. - research findings that report favorably on male traits are viewed as less credible - research that reports unfavorably on women is viewed as less credible - pro-female bias is deliberately misconstrued as being harmful...




incels.is





In this thread I linked research that showed that people in academia have a tendency to excuse findings that reflect negatively on women.
When a finding shines a bad light on women, they suddenly become all critical and say oh we have to be more careful and oh, we have to check the methodology etc.
Its a joke.
The quote I posted above is a great example of this. ""Women fuck more than men? Impossiboru!""

I've also shown another example in my psychopathy thread, where they did live brainstate monitoring on women and found that their pleasure centers light up from causing their partners pain. That's what we objectively observe. But then the researchers twist this into ""this means women value commitment from men.""
No comment.









Women gain happiness from seeing their partner upset - because it 'shows their relationship is strong'


Psychologists believe that women gain happiness from seeing their partners unhappy as being able to spot their other halves' bad moods shows the strength of their relationship.




www.dailymail.co.uk








“Lead researcher Shiri Cohen of Harvard Medical School explained why women's brains showed a positive reaction to seeing their husband or partner upset. She said: 'It could be that for women, seeing that their male partner is upset reflects some degree of the man's investment and emotional engagement in the relationship, even during difficult times.”

Click to expand...


Finally, in the 2013 re-run of the original 2003 lie-detector study, it was found that:

“Women are reporting significantly more partners than the men.”
""Fisher said the findings should raise flags with researchers who use surveys to study sexuality ""
""The average age of the study participants was 18, and the overwhelming majority of them were white.""
""It was unclear why, 10 years later, women were now reporting that they had a greater number of partners than men""

In this interview he gives an example of how foids hate their husbands but virtue signal on social media:




STEPHENS-DAVIDOWITZ: My favorite example is I compared how people describe their husbands on social media and on Google when they're not telling anybody. The No. 1 way they complete the phrase, my husband is, on social media is my husband is the best. I wanted to see if that's an accurate view of marriage. I looked when people are by themselves and they're not showing off to their friends, what do they search about their husbands on Google?

CHANG: And...

STEPHENS-DAVIDOWITZ: And it's a totally different view of marriage. It's, my husband is a jerk, so annoying, mean, obnoxious, cheating on me.

CHANG: And you look at the specific post, my husband is dot, dot, dot.

STEPHENS-DAVIDOWITZ: Yeah, exactly.

Another one that is crucial to unlock a key female behavior we all know, this time from the actual book:




Further, while the fact that men are obsessed with their penis size may not be too surprising, the biggest bodily insecurity for women, as expressed on Google, is surprising indeed. Based on this new data, the female equivalent of worrying about the size of your penis may be—pausing to build suspense—worrying about whether your vagina smells.

Click to expand...





Women make nearly as many searches expressing concern about their genitals as men do worrying about theirs. And the top concern women express is its odor—and how they might improve it. I certainly didn’t know that before I saw the data.

Click to expand...





Women, like men, have questions about their genitals. In fact, they have nearly as many questions about their vaginas as men have about their penises. Women’s worries about their vaginas are often health related. But at least 30 percent of their questions take up other concerns. Women want to know how to shave it, tighten it, and make it taste better. A strikingly common concern, as touched upon earlier, is how to improve its odor.

Click to expand...







Women are most frequently concerned that their vaginas smell like fish, followed by vinegar, onions, ammonia, garlic, cheese, body odor, urine, bread, bleach, feces, sweat, metal, feet, garbage, and rotten meat.

This is why women are obsessed with perfumes.
Add to that that most women don't shower, and you get the full picture:









British study shows 4 out of 5 women don't shower every day


A new survey out of England found four out of five women don't shower every day. Nearly two out of three women also don't take off their makeup before bed.




abc7.com





All the accusations of
""take a shower""
""i want a guy with good hygiene""
etc.

It's a mix of projection and asserting dominance by putting THE GUY on eggshells about HIS smell (meanwhile foids are the ones actually anxious about their smell).

Now I will bless you with other choice quotes from the book:

Self-Reported Female Sex Frequency:



According to that survey, when it comes to heterosexual sex, women say they have sex, on average, fifty-five times per year, using a condom 16 percent of the time. This adds up to about 1.1 billion condoms used per year. But heterosexual men say they use 1.6 billion condoms every year. Those numbers, by definition, would have to be the same. So who is telling the truth, men or women?

Click to expand...

That's at least once a week woha.

Significant Numbers of Foids Watch Incest Porn:



Of the top hundred searches by men on PornHub, one of the most popular porn sites, sixteen are looking for incest-themed videos. Fair warning—this is going to get a little graphic: they include “brother and sister,” “step mom fucks son,” “mom and son,” “mom fucks son,” and “real brother and sister.” The plurality of male incestuous searches are for scenes featuring mothers and sons.
And women? Nine of the top hundred searches by women on PornHub are for incest-themed videos, and they feature similar imagery—though with the gender of any parent and child who is mentioned usually reversed. Thus the plurality of incestuous searches made by women are for scenes featuring fathers and daughters.

Click to expand...

This one is not surprising since women probably get away with way more pedophilia than men.
When I was homeless I met this guy who said he divorced his wife after finding out she was playing with his kids genitals.

Also from MRA Archive:


60% of children molested in daycares, women are perpetrators (source)
Women perpetrators involved in 45% of child molestations (22% female-only perpetrator + 23% both male and female perpetrators) (source)
Of cases of abuse perpetrated by parents, mothers more likely than fathers to be abusors (73% vs. 23%) (source)
71% of Children Killed by One Parent are Killed by Their Mothers; 60% of Victims are Boys (source)
This site has more info for anyone interested:

Women disproportionally watch violent abusive porn:



Among the top PornHub searches by women is a genre of pornography that, I warn you, will disturb many readers: sex featuring violence against women. Fully 25 percent of female searches for straight porn emphasize the pain and/or humiliation of the woman—“painful anal crying,” “public disgrace,” and “extreme brutal gangbang,” for example. Five percent look for nonconsensual sex—“rape” or “forced” sex—even though these videos are banned on PornHub. And search rates for all these terms are at least twice as common among women as among men. If there is a genre of porn in which violence is perpetrated against a woman, my analysis of the data shows that it almost always appeals disproportionately to women.

Click to expand...



Dickpill: Women google less dick related shit but when they do, its about how their pussy got wrecked by big cock:



Do women care about penis size? Rarely, according to Google searches. For every search women make about a partner’s phallus, men make roughly 170 searches about their own. True, on the rare occasions women do express concerns about a partner’s penis, it is frequently about its size, but not necessarily that it’s small. More than 40 percent of complaints about a partner’s penis size say that it’s too big. “Pain” is the most Googled word used in searches with the phrase “___ during sex.” (“Bleeding,” “peeing,” “crying,” and “farting” round out the top five.)

Women getting insane amounts of surgery without telling:



Every year in the United States, there are more than seven million searches looking into breast implants. Official statistics tell us that about 300,000 women go through with the procedure annually.

Click to expand...

Basically, all of us have met foids that have gotten surgery without knowing it. Yet they continue to gaslight men about looks.

Women trying everything in their power to have abortions and kill babies:



In 2015, in the United States, there were more than 700,000 Google searches looking into self-induced abortions. By comparison, there were some 3.4 million searches for abortion clinics that year. This suggests that a significant percentage of women considering an abortion have contemplated doing it themselves.

Women searched, about 160,000 times, for ways of getting abortion pills through unofficial channels—“buy abortion pills online” and “free abortion pills.” They asked Google about abortion by herbs like parsley or by vitamin C. There were some 4,000 searches looking for directions on coat hanger abortions, including about 1,300 for the exact phrase “how to do a coat hanger abortion.” There were also a few hundred looking into abortion through bleaching one’s uterus and punching one’s stomach.

Click to expand...


So all in all, water wet for anyone who is into this data.
Its the usual.

Women hate kids.
Motherly instinct not real.
Women love abusive sex with big dicks.

I will attach the actual book here, but I must say its pretty valueless. Aside from what I quoted, he simps for foids and really does not contribute much.

"The hoax of ""mental illness""",Serious,the.oracle,"May 4, 2022",22000,136,"First let's read this, at the end are my arguments and analysis:









Thomas Szasz - Wikipedia







en.wikipedia.org








[UWSL]Szasz's main arguments[/UWSL]​Szasz was convinced there was a metaphorical character to mental disorders, and its uses in psychiatry were frequently injurious. He set himself a task to delegitimize legitimating agencies and authorities, and what he saw as their vast powers, enforced by psychiatrists and other mental health professionals, mental health laws, mental health courts, and mental health sentences.[11][UWSL]: 22 [/UWSL]
Szasz was a critic of the influence of modern medicine on society, which he considered to be the secularization of religion's hold on humankind. Criticizing scientism, he targeted psychiatry in particular, underscoring its campaigns against masturbation at the end of the 19th century, its use of medical imagery and language to describe misbehavior, its reliance on involuntary mental hospitalization to protect society, and the use of lobotomy and other interventions to treat psychosis. To sum up his description of the political influence of medicine in modern societies imbued by faith in science, he declared:



Since theocracy is the rule of God or its priests, and democracy the rule of the people or of the majority, pharmacracy is therefore the rule of medicine or of doctors.[12][[UWSL]page needed[/UWSL]]

Click to expand...

Szasz consistently paid attention to the power of language in the establishment and maintenance of the social order, both in small interpersonal and in wider social, economic, and/or political spheres:



The struggle for definition is veritably the struggle for life itself. In the typical Western two men fight desperately for the possession of a gun that has been thrown to the ground: whoever reaches the weapon first shoots and lives; his adversary is shot and dies. In ordinary life, the struggle is not for guns but for words; whoever first defines the situation is the victor; his adversary, the victim. For example, in the family, husband and wife, mother and child do not get along; who defines whom as troublesome or mentally sick?... [the one] who first seizes the word imposes reality on the other; [the one] who defines thus dominates and lives; and [the one] who is defined is subjugated and may be killed.[13][UWSL]: 85 [/UWSL]

Click to expand...

His main arguments can be summarized as follows:
[UWSL]""Myth of mental illness""[/UWSL]​""Mental illness"" is an expression, a metaphor that describes an offending, disturbing, shocking, or vexing conduct, action, or pattern of behavior, such as packaged under the wide-ranging term schizophrenia, as an ""illness"" or ""disease"". Szasz wrote: ""If you talk to God, you are praying; If God talks to you, you have schizophrenia. If the dead talk to you, you are a spiritualist; If you talk to the dead, you are a schizophrenic.""[13][UWSL]: 85 [/UWSL] He maintained that, while people behave and think in disturbing ways, and those ways may resemble a disease process (pain, deterioration, response to various interventions), this does not mean they actually have a disease. To Szasz, disease can only mean something people ""have"", while behavior is what people ""do"". Diseases are ""malfunctions of the human body, of the heart, the liver, the kidney, the brain"" while ""no behavior or misbehavior is a disease or can be a disease. That's not what diseases are."" Szasz cited drapetomania as an example of a behavior that many in society did not approve of, being labeled and widely cited as a disease. Likewise, women who did not bend to a man's will were said to have hysteria.[14] He thought that psychiatry actively obscures the difference between behavior and disease in its quest to help or harm parties in conflicts. He maintained that, by calling people diseased, psychiatry attempts to deny them responsibility as moral agents in order to better control them. 
In Szasz's view, people who are said by themselves or others to have a mental illness can only have, at best, ""problems in living"". Diagnoses of ""mental illness"" or ""mental disorder"" (the latter expression called by Szasz a ""weasel term"" for mental illness) are passed off as ""scientific categories"" but they remain merely judgments (judgments of disdain) to support certain uses of power by psychiatric authorities. In that line of thinking, schizophrenia becomes not the name of a disease entity but a judgment of extreme psychiatric and social disapprobation. Szasz called schizophrenia ""the sacred symbol of psychiatry"" because those so labeled have long provided and continue to provide justification for psychiatric theories, treatments, abuses, and reforms.
The figure of the psychotic or schizophrenic person to psychiatric experts and authorities, according to Szasz, is analogous with the figure of the heretic or blasphemer to theological experts and authorities. According to Szasz, to understand the metaphorical nature of the term ""disease"" in psychiatry, one must first understand its literal meaning in the rest of medicine. To be a true disease, the entity must first somehow be capable of being approached, measured, or tested in scientific fashion. Second, to be confirmed as a disease, a condition must demonstrate pathology at the cellular or molecular level.
A genuine disease must also be found on the autopsy table (not merely in the living person) and meet pathological definition instead of being voted into existence by members of the American Psychiatric Association. ""Mental illnesses"" are really problems in living. They are often ""like a"" disease, argued Szasz, which makes the medical metaphor understandable, but in no way validates it as an accurate description or explanation. Psychiatry is a pseudoscience that parodies medicine by using medical-sounding words invented especially over the last one hundred years. To be clear, heart break and heart attack, or spring fever and typhoid fever belong to two completely different logical categories, and treating one as the other constitutes a category error. Psychiatrists are the successors of ""soul doctors"", priests who dealt and deal with the spiritual conundrums, dilemmas, and vexations – the ""problems in living"" – that have troubled people forever.
Psychiatry's main methods are assessment, medication, conversation or rhetoric and incarceration. To the extent that psychiatry presents these problems as ""medical diseases"", its methods as ""medical treatments"", and its clients – especially involuntary – as medically ill patients, it embodies a lie and therefore constitutes a fundamental threat to freedom and dignity. Psychiatry, supported by the state through various Mental Health Acts, has become a modern secular state religion according to Szasz. It is a vastly elaborate social control system, using both brute force and subtle indoctrination, which disguises itself under the claims of being rational, systematic and therefore scientific.
[UWSL]""Patient"" as m[/UWSL][UWSL]alingerer[/UWSL]​According to Szasz, many people fake their presentation of mental illness, i.e., they are malingering. They do so for gain, for example, in order to escape a burden like evading the draft, or to gain access to drugs or financial support, or for some other personally meaningful reason. By definition, the malingerer is knowingly deceitful (although malingering itself has also been called a mental illness or disorder). Szasz mentions malingering in many of his works, but it is not what he has in mind to explain many other manifestations of so-called ""mental illness"". In those cases, so-called ""patients"" have something personally significant to communicate – their ""problems in living"" – but unable to express this via conventional means they resort to illness-imitation behaviour, a somatic protolanguage or ""body language"", which psychiatrists and psychologists have misguidedly interpreted as the signs/symptoms of real illness.[15] So, for example, ""analyzing the origin of the hysterical protolanguage Szasz states that it has a double origin: – the first root is in the somatic structure of human being. The human body is subject to illnesses and disabilities expressed through somatic signs (like paralysis, convulsions, etc.) and somatic sensations (like pain, tiredness, etc.); – the second root can be found into cultural factors.""[16]

""Mental illnesses"" are simply non-conformity behaviours relating to social norms. These behaviours arise from negative experiences throughout life, i.e. actions resulting in prejudicial outcomes for the agent or subject of other's actions.

The mental ""re-living"" of these experiences one goes through by remembering in their minds these instances causes in turn these ""problems of living"" to the receptacle of such life experiences, leading to a loop of non-conformity.

External factors causes these ""non-conforming"" behaviours, because only in a social setting there can be such a thing as non-conformity. That's why ""mental illness"" is simply a social construct. If you were living alone in an island, there would be no such thing.

But when living in a social setting, patterns for acceptable and non-acceptable behaviour arises and those who do not fit are treated as to be excluded from the benefits of social living.

For instance, if you are ugly, short, bald, deformed, ""shy"" (""non-NT""), ethnic, you are not fitting the social pattern of acceptability, therefore you are excluded from the benefits of social living, or your participation in these social settings is lessened and not as beneficial as for those who conform, let's say the job market, dating market, familial relationships, friendships, etc.

This rejection causes these problems in living: you are not able to conform, and knowing the Black Pill, you know most of these factors for acceptance are out of your control, so realizing and re-living these past negative experiences makes a consciousness arise, that you are not able to conform either because the factors are outside of your control or because of missed opportunities (let's say you become too old to enter a carreer, or to have actual functional sex, which should be had by fertile men and women).

That is the whole reason shrinks (psychologists) are scammers. They are the same as poets or philosophers, they simply play a non-scientific game where they make conclusions based upon established social norms (which can and in fact do affect scientific methodology itself). If you remove the scientific veil of this profession, you will understand that shrinks can only ""help"" you realize things about yourself or about the exterior world.

If you are able to conform again, you are ""cured"", if you do not succeed (as most incels won't), you will still be considered ""mentally ill"".

THIS IS WHY ONLY PEOPLE THAT CAN SOMEHOW FIT THE SOCIAL STANDARD OF ACCEPTABILITY CAN BE ""CURED"" FROM THEIR ""MENTAL ILLNESS"". A foid, simply by having a wet stinky hole, can always be cured from her ""mental illness"" in this gynocentric world, because she will always be accepted in some degree. A good-looking man, even if he has past traumas and has abused drugs, can also be ""cured"" because he can always be able to conform as long as he realize what he has to do in order to conform, and his non-changeable features are already conforming to acceptable standards.

Psychiatrists are also scammers. Jewpills can't ""cure"" your ""mental illness"". They can only stimulate or supress your biological and innate immune system in some way, just like any other type of medicine will. They can only control the symptoms of your problems in living, they will deactivate your receptors and turn you into a robot devoid of the ability to face your sadness and trauma from bad experiences rationally, thus dumbing you down to your own suffering.

I myself am thinking of getting a prescription for some of these Jewpills, not because I believe they can ""cure"" me from my ""mental issues"", but because I know they can be able to ""anesthetize"" my mind from re-experiencing these past disappointments with such force and frequency, just like weed did for me (it lost effect over time though and I'm currently unable to get more from a dealer), or alcohol can do for some. It will warp my mind to a parallel world where I can live with myself only and not care about the social structure that denies my conformity in the first place. Why do I want to do this? Because I don't want to and am probably unable to conform.

If I wanted to be ""cured"", I'd have to go to a psychologist to brainwash me into thinking I can somehow conform by doing ""x"" or ""y"", but I know for a fact that's not the case. Everytime I tried to adopt a bluepilled/NPC belief, it gave me some false hope and sense of belonging, a sense that I could try again some other way and finally achieve conformity. But in the long run this will inevitably lead to more sorrow, because by exposing yourself again to these social experiences you will be again rejected and fail to conform if you do not have the features that fit the standard of conformity.

This is why the Redpill can actually be damaging to many many men, like it was to me. You set yourself for bigger disappointments by ""working on yourself"" and spending time, money and effort trying to reach things you were never able to achieve. The higher the mountain, the bigger the fall. Their copout for this reality? ""Don't do it for women/others/status, do it for yourself"".

""Mental illness"" treatment can ""work"" for some people (as said, foids and good looking men, for instance) because by ""adopting a positive mindset"" they can expose themselves again to social settings and get their dopamine hits, validation and positive reinforcement, thus opening ground for them to conform again and live ""healthy"" and NPC lives.

I've been close to people (male and female) that supposedly suffered from ""depression"", ""schizophrenia"", ""bipolar disorder"" and other ""mental illnesses"", and I can say that based on my analysis, backed by mountains of proof, that they simply (for some reason or another) were going though bad times and were not achieving what they wanted to achieve, or simply had too high standards in their minds they needed to achieve (either socially enforced standards or standards they set to themselves based on false concepts of reality and what's achievable based on the hand you are delt - genetics, where you're born, in which family you're born, etc). As soon as some external factor gets better and they again have the possibility to conform and live up to social standards, they get ""better"" from their ""illnesses"" and can live pleasant and healthy lives as most NPCs do in their own ignorance.

Like every commodity there is, there is a market for it. ""Mental illness"" is not only a good market for medicine professionals and Jewpill companies, especially because the solutions can cause dependence in individuals consooming these ""goods"", but it is also a great weapon for the government, elites, etc (i.e. the ruling class, the winners of societal standards), it can be used for control, for them to feel better in comparison to you for not conforming, and most important: to shove all kinds of dangerous ideas that can go against their established order, the order of things that benefits them and exclude you.

You are not mentally ill, I am not mentally ill, we are simply outside of the conformity overton window."

RESULTS: There was an inverse association between soy food intake and sperm concentration that remained significant after accounting for age, abstinence time, body mass index, caffeine and alcohol intake and smoking. In univariate analyses, soy food and isoflavone intakes were inversely related to sperm concentration (Table II). This association was strongest for soy foods. In the multivariate-adjusted analyses, men in the highest category of soy food intake had 41 million sperm/ml less than men who did not consume soy foods, and there was a statistically significant trend toward decreasing sperm concentration with increasing soy foods intake (P, trend = 0.03). The results for individual isoflavones mirrored the results for soy foods and were strongest for glycitein. Men in the highest intake level of glycitein had, on average, 33 million sperm/ml less than men without any glycitein intake (95% CI: −68, 2) with a suggestion of a linear trend (P, trend = 0.08).
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that higher intake of soy foods and soy isoflavones is associated with lower sperm concentration.​

We present the case of a 19-y-old type 1 diabetic but otherwise healthy man with sudden onset of loss of libido and erectile dysfunction after the ingestion of large quantities of soy-based products in a vegan-style diet. Blood levels of free and total testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were taken at the initial presentation for examination and continuously monitored up to 2 y after discontinuation of the vegan diet. Blood concentrations of free and total testosterone were initially decreased, whereas DHEA was increased. These parameters normalized within 1 y after cessation of the vegan diet. Normalization of testosterone and DHEA levels was paralleled by a constant improvement of symptoms; full sexual function was regained 1 y after cessation of the vegan diet. This case indicates that soy product consumption is related to hypogonadism and erectile dysfunction.​

BACKGROUND: This study has addressed concerns about possible effects of feeding human infants soy formula milk (SFM). METHODS: This is a feeding study in marmosets, using a mainly co-twin design. From 4–5 until 35–45 days of age, co-twin males were fed by hand with either standard (cow) formula milk (SMA = controls) or with SFM for ~8 h each day (2 h at weekends) and intake related to bodyweight. Blood samples were collected at 18–20 and at 35–45 days of age in 13 sets of co-twins plus two non-twin males per group and, at the later age, seven sets of co-twins were killed and the testes and pituitary gland fixed for cell counts.
RESULTS: Weight gain and formula intake were similar in both feeding groups. SMA-fed males had mean testosterone levels of 2.8–3.1 ng/ml, typical of the ‘neonatal testosterone rise’, whereas SFM-fed males exhibited consistently lower mean levels (1.2–2.6 ng/ml); paired comparison in SMA-and SFM-fed co-twins at day 35–45 revealed 53–70% lower levels in 11 of 13 co-twins fed with SFM (P = 0.004). Further evidence for suppression of testosterone levels in SFM-fed males came from comparison of the frequency of low testosterone levels (<0.5 ng/ml).​

Soy-based products contained potent estrogenicity of 100-1500ng estradiol equivalents per kilogram (EEQ/kg). The estrogenicity in soy-free products was far lower (10-40ng EEQ/kg). We also detected significant estrogenic activity in three infant formulas (14-22ng EEQ/kg). Furthermore, we found soy lecithin to be strongly estrogenic. It might, therefore, be a major contributor to total estrogenicity.​

Phytic acid binds with zinc readily in intestines, lowering its absorption. A deficiency of copper or high proportion of zinc than copper leads to increased blood cholesterol.

""I don’t ever drink soy milk or eat tofu more than once a month. Is that still too much? So does dipping some dumplings in Soy Sauce once a week wreck you?""
""Who out there is eating soy at these levels? Jesus""​

Click to expand...

People in Japan and Korea consume foods containing natto, soy sauce and soybean paste every day. Adolescent students in places like Hong Kong drink vitasoy every morning. Shanghainese people of all ages drink soy milk every morning because of its purported health benefits.

Soy (and legumes as a whole) are nature's most effective chemical castration drug. Soy lecithine is present in all kinds of food, including but not limited to dietary supplements, ice cream, dairy products, sweets and ready-made confectionery, margarine, packaged supermarket breads, chocolate bars, and other convenience foods.

20000 ng of isoflavone content is in one tablespoon of soy sauce, the least harmfully estrogenic soy-derived product. Other sources state that there is 400000-2200000 ng of isoflavone content in one tablespoon of soy sauce. A pre-pubescent child's body contains 41000 ng of natural estrogen, an adult man's body around 136000 ng.

One birth control pill contains 35000 nanograms of estrogen. Japanese men consume the equivalent of ~198 birth control pills in the form of soy every day, since they eat on average 0.59 ounces of soy a day.

Examples of the average isoflavone content of some foods include:​
half a cup of soybeans – 40 to 75 mg isoflavones​
quarter cup of soy flour – 45 to 69 mg isoflavones​
one 250ml glass of soy drink – 15 to 60 mg isoflavones​
one 115g block of tofu – 13 to 43 mg isoflavones​
one 110g block of tempeh – 41 mg isoflavones​
one container of soy yoghurt – 26 mg isoflavones​
two slices of soy bread – 7 to 15 mg isoflavones​
teaspoon of soy sauce – 0.4 to 2.2 mg isoflavones​
[1 mg = 1000000 ng]

Soybean oil is causing widespread, irreversible decline in public health across the world due to its cheapness and availability.

A man's natural androgens and other important hormones are affected by unhealthy lifestyle choices. Low assertiveness, low energy, being less confrontational, significantly less athletic, of shorter stature, physically smaller and less muscular, having a higher voice, higher body fat, difficulty gaining mass, lower libido, insulin resistance, early-onset balding, impotence, the inability to produce offspring, inferior neurogenesis, increased likelihood of depression are all consequences of androgenic deficiency.

B. Estrogen effect on bone growth and how to inhibit it.
Treatment of short stature with certain​inhibitors will delay bone maturation and increase height.
By Michael Burke
Body Image Solutions

Researchers are currently using a potent P450-aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, because of its ability to delay bone maturation and increase final adult height.
Estrogen plays an essential role in the regulation of bone maturation and ultimately causes bones to fuse resulting in increased adult height.
Studies have proven and shown that letrozole is the key inhibitor in stopping estrogen from causing bone maturation.
As a result, young adults who were given letrozole reached an average increased final adult height of 5.1 cm (2 inches) during the five month treatment which is remarkable considering the fact that they did not have to do anything for the additional height.
Had these same individuals undergone a strict anaerobic stretching exercise program which has been proven to increase human growth hormone levels substantially they would have gained an average of four-five inches instead of two.
The inhibition of estrogen synthesis delayed bone maturation. These findings indicates that an increase in adult height can be attained in growing adolescent boys or even adults who have open growth plates by inhibiting of estrogen action.​A lot of teenager gain height when they high dose amino acids presented below:

L-Ornithine
L-Arginine HCL
L-Lysine
L-Tyrosine
L-Glutamine
L-Glycine
Therefore, the pubertal growth rate of young adults can be blocked thereby preventing bone maturation and increasing final height prognosis.~*


C. Diet may be the main driver of height growth for the long term effect through every generation. 
[UWSL] [/UWSL]
Gene are likely not the main driver of height, despite the mainstream dogma vehement claiming to the contrary.

Intelligence and height are often presented as two of the most genetically driven variables of any given human. Below is yet another study demonstrating that switching to a diet containing animal protein allowed the Chinese boys to gain ~10cm on average over a period of just 25 years. Considering the 50% height of a 12-year old Chinese boy in 1985 was around 120cm, the ~10cm gain represents a whopping 8% increase in height. That change is highly statistically significant and cannot be explained by any statistical manipulations as a fluke.

https://www.economist.com/internati...g-is-on-the-rise-bringing-surprising-benefits

""...In the decade to 2017 global meat consumption rose by an average of 1.9% a year and fresh dairy consumption by 2.1% -- both about twice as fast as population growth. Almost four-fifths of all agricultural land is dedicated to feeding livestock, if you count not just pasture but also cropland used to grow animal feed… It is largely through eating more pork and dairy that Chinese diets have come to resemble Western ones, rich in protein and fat. And it is mostly because their diets have altered that Chinese people have changed shape. The average 12-year-old urban boy was nine centimetres taller in 2010 than in 1985, the average girl seven centimetres taller.""

A well studied phenomenon officially explained by genes, but recently recast as one possibly due to diet.

Now this new study adds more evidence to the diet hypothesis as it found a population in my native Balkans that should be (and sometimes is) even taller than the Dutch, but the realization of that potential depends on protein quality. The mountain men whose diet consists mainly of dairy, eggs and meat, realized that potential and are on average taller than the Dutch and thus the tallest in the world. However, the people with the same genes living in the bigger cities and eating commercial crap that passes as food are actually on average some of the shortest in Europe.
So, once again, diet (and maybe high CO2 from living in mountains) is elucidated as the main factor that drives height and possibly overall health. It would be interesting to also see longevity charts separated within the same population groups examined by the study. I bet the mountain men also live longer and have much lower incidence of chronic diseases.
So, naturally the question is this - what is good quality protein vs. poor quality protein? Well, it's in the quotes below but basically animal protein rules and cereals/grains are crap. Tell that to the vicious vegan munching on a his heap of grass next to you in the cafeteria.
Finally, if people in B&H are expected to continue growing depending on their diet then we can chalk height - one of the holliest pillars of geneticism - off to diet and socioeconomis conditions. If height is not due to genes then I don't see much hope for the genetic theory of diseases. I suppose it also means we should all be focusing on animal protein to realize our genetic height potential, and Ray's assertions that he grew an inch and a half in his 40s due to using DHEA may be actually due to his insistence on consuming animal protein instead of plant one.

The mountains of giants: an anthropometric survey of male youths in Bosnia and Herzegovina | Open Science
Move Over, Dutch Men. Herzegovinians May Be Tallest in World | American Council on Science and Health
""...The Dutch are famous for windmills, impressive feats of geoengineering, and being tall and blonde. At a towering 183.8 cm (just over 6 feet tall), Dutch men are widely hailed as the tallest in the world. But new data suggests that men from regions within the Balkan country of Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H) are even taller. The inhabitants of B&H display a large variation in average height. This is due to a combination of factors, such as genetics, religion, and socioeconomics. B&H is a multiethnic country, so the genetic background of its citizens is varied. Religion influences a person's dietary choices (e.g., Muslims avoid pork), while socioeconomic status affects the nutritional value of the food that a person can obtain. Just over half the population of B&H is Muslim, and the country is one of the poorest in Europe.""

""...The tallest citizens of B&H lived in Herzegovina (the southern part of the country through which the Dinaric Alps cross), who measured on average 183.6 cm, a mere 0.2 cm shy of the Dutch. But in some regions of Herzegovina, the average man was 184 cm or taller2. In the Trebinje region at the southern tip of the country, the men were 184.5 cm, besting the Dutch by more than a quarter of an inch.""

""...But the average male Herzegovinian isn't that tall. Why? That's where the other factor, nutrition, comes into play. Average male height in a nation is also correlated with protein quality. Nations that consume more protein in the form of pork, dairy, eggs, and fish tend to be taller, while those that attain more protein from cereals tend to be shorter. (The graph on the right shows that the Dutch have a diet rich in high-quality protein, while Bosnians and Herzegovinians do not.)

""...Because of the large Muslim population, many Herzegovinians don't eat pork. In an email to ACSH, Dr. Grasgruber says that the religious prohibition on pork may be largely to blame for the shorter average stature of Herzegovinians. Indeed, regions with a greater fraction of Muslims were shorter than regions with fewer Muslims. Additionally, poverty plays a role, as citizens of B&H were 1.9 cm taller if both of their parents went to university.""

""...Together, the data suggests that Herzegovinians have the genetic potential to be more than two inches taller than the Dutch, but many currently do not achieve that potential due to nutritional choices and poverty. Can we ever expect the Herzegovinians to surpass the Dutchmen? Yes, ""give it 20-30 years,"" Dr. Grasgruber said. We'll check back on them in the year 2040.""


The Lamarckian story does not end with that study, which has been criticized by both forum users and scientists that it is simply observational and cannot separate the effects of maybe yet another unknown genetic variable that could fully control height independently of diet. Well, below is yet another fascinating article on the importance of environment over genes. And since the studies that article discusses used animals they were interventional and not just an association. So, the superiority of environment over genetics when it comes to height, and (just as importantly) the ability to pass on these non-genomic changes in height to offspring are on full display once again, and in many different species. And apparently, the effects of low-protein diet extend beyond just height.
http://nautil.us/issue/58/self/heredity-beyond-the-gene

""...But is any of this enormous environmentally induced variation in male phenotype transmitted across generations? To find out, we generated variation in male body size by rearing some larvae on a nutrient-rich larval medium, while rearing their siblings on a diluted medium. This resulted in sets of large and small brothers, which we then paired with females that had all been reared on the same larval food. When we measured the offspring, we found that large males produced larger offspring than their small brothers, and subsequent work showed that this nongenetic paternal effect is probably mediated by substances transferred in the seminal fluid.34,35However, because T. angusticollis males transfer a tiny ejaculate, orders of magnitude smaller than the typical nutrient-laden ejaculates produced by males of some insect species, this effect does not appear to involve the transfer of nutrients from males to females or to their offspring.""


""...There is ample evidence that parental diet can affect offspring in mammals as well. Experimental research on the effects of diet in rats—particularly the restriction of key nutrients such as protein—began in the first half of the 20th century with the objective of gaining insight into the health consequences of malnutrition. In the 1960s, researchers were intrigued to discover that female rats fed a low-protein diet during pregnancy produced offspring and grand-offspring that were sickly and scrawny and had relatively small brains with a reduced number of neurons, scoring poorly on tests of intelligence and memory. In recent years, research efforts have turned to understanding the effects of excessive or unbalanced nutrient intake, using rats and mice as experimental models to gain insight into the human obesity epidemic, and it is now well-established that both maternal and paternal diets can have a variety of effects on offspring development and health. Some of these effects come about via epigenetic reprogramming of embryonic stem cells in the womb. For example, in rats, a high-fat maternal diet has been shown to reduce the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells (which give rise to blood cells), while a maternal diet rich in methyl-donors has been found to promote the proliferation of neuronal stem cells in embryos.37,38 In rats, a high-fat paternal diet has been found to cause reduced insulin secretion and glucose tolerance in daughters.39 There is evidence of such effects in humans as well.""

""...Stepping back to survey the current state of knowledge in the study of extended heredity, we are reminded of genetics in the 1920s or molecular biology in the 1950s. We know just enough to fathom the depths of our ignorance and to recognize the challenges that lie ahead. But one conclusion that is already beyond reasonable doubt is that the Galtonian assumptions that have shaped both empirical and theoretical research for nearly a century are violated in many contexts, and this means that biology has exciting times before it. Empirical researchers will be busy for many years exploring the mechanisms of nongenetic inheritance, observing its ecological effects, and establishing its evolutionary consequences. This work will require developing new tools and devising ingenious experiments. Theoreticians have the equally important task of clarifying ideas and generating predictions. And on a practical level, in medicine and public health, it is now equally clear that we need not be “passive transmitters of a nature we have received,” because our life experiences play a nontrivial role in shaping the hereditary “nature” that we transmit to our children.""

Cognitive Behavioural Therapy: Organized Self-Deception and the antithesis of the Blackpill,Untagged,Deleted member 4804,"Sep 6, 2021",12000,63,"So I don't often post here but I've been thinking about this for a while. Today I'm going to redpill you on what Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is.
What is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy?​Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is the most popular therapy technique today. It's stated goals are to allow patients to identify ""distortions in their thinking"" and better understand reality. Here's a link to an information guide from the Centre of Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) I'll be referencing during this post.

https://camh.ca/-/media/files/guides-and-publications/cbt-guide-en.pdf

In reality, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is designed to allow you to do the following, in order:

Recognize negative perceptions you have about yourself and reality
Dismiss these perceptions as false by using premade refutations
Believe that you can control your circumstances
Eventually change your ""core beliefs"" so that you no longer think your circumstances are bad
Note that ""truth"" enters nowhere into the equation. The guide I've linked above makes many mentions about ""rationality"" and how certain thoughts are illogical. These are lies. The fundamental belief about Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is that you, the patient, need to recognize that if you perceive reality negatively, you are irrational. It does not matter whether your perception of reality is true or false. The fact that it is making you sad means that you are insane.

The problem with this, of course, is that most people are not able to bend their perception of reality to make ""2+2=5"", so to speak, solely because believing that 2+2=5 makes them feel good. So Cognitive Behavioural Therapy works by removing your ability to think for yourself. It does this by convincing you that the negative thoughts you are having about yourself are ""automatic""; i.e. not within your control. It then categorizes many common types of thoughts and provides ways to refute them.
Peter the Incel​Let's go back to the CAMH guide and get an example. Chapter 3 mentions Peter, an incel. I'll copy and paste the dialogue here for people who don't want to click on the PDF.

Click to expand...

Peter is sad. He recognizes that most people are in happy relationships. Peter himself is not in a relationship. He is sad and angry because of this, as Peter values being in a relationship. Peter is having a normal reaction to not being able to fulfill his goals in life. He feels as if he will never be in a relationship. Let's analyze what the guide says are questions a therapist might ask.



“Do you know anyone that you like and respect who is not currently in a relationship?”

Click to expand...





“Do you have any past experiences in romantic relationships?”

Click to expand...





“If you had a good friend that had the same thoughts about himself or herself, what would you say to that friend?”

Click to expand...





“Are you possibly discounting any life experiences to suggest that you will not be completely alone?”

Click to expand...





“Are you potentially blaming yourself for something that you do not have complete control of?”

Click to expand...

Note what isn't said. Question 1, for example, says that Peter should look at other people who aren't currently in a relationship. This is designed to make Peter feel as if his condition is temporary, or that it might change. Sure, you might not currently be in a relationship, but maybe you'll find someone to be with in the future!

Let's analyze Questions 2 and 4. They look logical, Peter should look at all of the evidence, right? But look at what isn't said. The therapist isn't asking Peter to look at all of his past, nor is the therapist asking Peter to examine any of the evidence that supports his current belief that he will always be alone. The therapist is just asking Peter to look at events in his life that go against his beliefs. This is called ""cherry-picking"" as a logical fallacy, and involves only looking at the evidence that supports a particular view. Peter should only think about the one time he held hands with a girl when he was 10 years old. Peter should not think about the hundreds of times he's been rejected in his life. He should look at his ""girlfriend"" he had for 3 months in middle school, not the 12 years he spent alone.

Question 3 is simpler, Peter should try to comfort himself and not feel sad like he might comfort a friend that was feeling sad. Nobody is going to tell their friend ""it's over give up"". 

Question 5 is nebulously worded. On the surface, it looks like the therapist is trying to tell Peter that he might not have control over his inability to be in a relationship, In actuality, it assumes that Peter has partial control over his situation, and tries to make Peter feel as if the situation is ""not his fault"", or that he didn't choose to be an incel. This lays the foundation for the next step of cognitive behavioural therapy, where Peter will discover that his lack of choice to be in a relationship means that he really chose not to be in a relationship.

What all of these questions have in common is that they are designed to change Peter's beliefs, by making Peter himself recognize that his thinking is wrong. Peter's thinking is being replaced here by the therapist's, with carefully controlled questions designed to make Peter think what is necessary. Read this doublethink quote from CAMH that agrees.



""The goal here is not to challenge Peter’s thinking but rather to move him to a questioning mode and to consider the accuracy of his automatic thoughts based on evidence from his life.""

Click to expand...

Peter's beliefs aren't being challenged here, Peter is just being made to ""question"" them. This is illogical, ""questioning"" and ""challenging"" a belief are the same thing to the point that ""Reflect on a time when you questioned or challenged a belief"" was a question on the US common application for universities last year. [1] But this misses that the goal here isn't for the therapist to challenge Peter's beliefs, but for Peter to automatically recognize his wrongthink and correct it.

Identifying and correcting cognitive distortions​This leads us into step number 2 of the four step guide I wrote above. Peter the Incel isn't going to be with his therapist 24/7. He won't always have someone to think for him. So to help prevent wrongthink, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy relies on identifying common depressing thoughts and trains you to remove them. 

For instance, ""Overgeneralization"", which in reality refers to any attempt to generalize your experiences and extrapolate future events. Let's say you installed Tinder and got 0 matches. The women on Tinder obviously thought you weren't attractive, so you might be tempted to say that it's possible that women in general will find you unattractive. This is when Cognitive Behavioural Therapy steps in, and you come up with a justification that ""Tinder isn't real life! Real life isn't a meat market! I should try Bumble/etc instead."" (notice how many normies say this? I wonder why). 

Or ""Black-or-white thinking"", which refers to any attempt to categorize your experiences into a binary. e.g., being a failure for not having sex, as opposed to being successful for having sex. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is designed to step in there, and tell you that there are plenty of different experiences and there's no such thing as being ""successful"" or ""failing"". The reason why this is so powerful is because ""binary oppositions"" are what all human thought are structured on (t. Saussure [2]). By ignoring binaries and pretending they don't exist, your thoughts will lose all meaning and no longer make sense. By eliminating the concepts of ""success"" and ""failure"" you will not feel like a failure. 

By creating catchy names and complex systems, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy allows you to identify and destroy rational thinking. After the ability to recognize wrongthink is firmly ingrained in your head, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy will teach you to...
Believe that you have control​Once the ability to wrongthink has been removed from your head, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is designed to make you have a feeling of control. At this point, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy starts to implement ""rightthink"" so to speak. For instance, in the CAMH document, Nancy wanted to drive up to her cottage, but was scared of having a panic attack. So she creates a table that lists the situation she's in, the ""automatic thoughts"" (i.e. wrongthink) she had about the situation, and the emotions she was having. This allows her to target those and feel like she's in control. 

This is no accident and it's why Cognitive Behavioural Therapy stresses the importance of worksheets and homework. It structures your thoughts (homework is often called the ""thought record"") to align with how therapists want you to think and more importantly lets you feel like you're in control. You'll see this in a lot of the advice given from normies to incels, like ""go to the gym"" or ""work on your personality"". The goal here is to make you feel like you're in control of your inability to have sex, regardless of if you actually are in control or not. if you don't believe me, here's a direct quote from the document:



The cbt therapist can then help you to question and evaluate these assumptions and beliefs and to generate less distressing, alternative viewpoints as they occur in upsetting situations.

Click to expand...

Structure your thoughts and soon you can generate ""alternative viewpoints"" for yourself!
Changing your core beliefs​The ultimate goal of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy though, is to change something that's called your ""core beliefs"". This means refiguring your value system to prevent yourself from becoming depressed ever again. Let's say one of your life goals is fulfilling sexual relationships. The ultimate goal of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is to remove that as one of your goals. That's why ""reformed incels"" say that sex really isn't that important anyways. They've reached that stage, and no longer want sex because CBT has convinced them not to. Of course, this is tough. That's why the ability of choice is so heavily emphasized. It is far easier to say you don't value sex if you're choosing not to have it, than to say you don't value sex when you can't have it. 

Once this core assumption is gone, the wrongthink that stems from it disappears. A core tenent of cognitive behavioural therapy is that your core beliefs spawn these negative thoughts, and once they are changed, wrongthink disappears as well. After all, if you no longer want sex, why would you be upset about being incel?"

"Incels are called ""psychopaths"" for analyzing society and advocating for a more ethical order, while actual psychopaths are loved by normies and foids",JFL,Atavistic Autist,"Feb 15, 2020",34000,128,"I just came across this thread on le Reddit, which argues that the amount of psychopaths/sociopaths/antisocial people in society is severely underestimated, which is a proposition I would agree with.

But the example the OP uses for unappreciated psychopaths is... us. JFL






Learning how social dynamics operate, especially as it concerns female nature (which our soyciety not only allows but encourages to be totally uninhibited and unrestrained), and detesting it as ""brutal"" and ""cruel"" is not psychopathy.

Psychopaths are the ones who prosper in modern society, and are enlivened by brutality and cruelty, not the ones who are victimized by it. The free-for-all environments of the feminist ""sexual marketplace"" and the capitalist economic marketplace are their playgrounds, where they are the bullies and we are the bullied. By virtue of being as exploitative and parasitic as possible in intent, yet extremely charming in affect, psychopaths automatically excel with foid-bloodsuckers and their equivalents in the social climbing game: rapacious, greedy scum in corporations and manipulative liars in politics.

Just take Pete Butt as an example. He is the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for president, and he is a literal psychopath. Since the age of 6 year old, he has been completely enamored by the need to climb the social ladder and become the most powerful man in the world. Virtually everything he's done in his life has had that end in mind: to build a resume which would qualify him for the presidency, and establish its superficial credentials, while internally he believes in nothing but his own ambitions for the ultimate reigns of authority. He would be the youngest president to ever take office. And normie and foid voters are actually letting him get as close as he is to his goal!

Pete Butt is also gay, something which he did not admit until it became politically expedient for him.

Here is another homosexual psychopath (diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder) who I found on le Reddit:





He is an avid supporter of capitalism, and argues that if the state punishes you for your antisocial behavior, and then a capitalist company decides not to hire you for it, that it is the fault of the state for punishing you for your antisocial behavior. Of course, he does not consider the fact that someone who commits crimes (i.e. a psychopath like him) might be responsible for the consequences of his own actions.





Here he is arguing that necrophilia is acceptable, because dead people have ""no value"" (implying that he thinks any living people do).





Here he is basically admitting to being a criminal. He also posts on a sex offender subreddit, and a ""LGBT libertarian"" subreddit.





Here he is justifying his bullying of others in school, because it was ""convenient."" And he states that attention/status just so happens to fall into his lap (teehee).

Alpha fucks, beta bucks
http://pillse.bol.ucla.edu/Publications/Pillsworth&Haselton_ARSR.pdf

There is abundant evidence that women, as well as men, desire long-term committed relationships; but there is also an emerging literature revealing a hidden side of women's desires suggesting that women have also evolved to pursue short-term or illicit affairs. The purpose of this article is to review these lines of evidence and other recent findings pertaining to the evolution of women's sexual strategies.
http://content.csbs.utah.edu/~cashdan/publications/ec_evolanth.pdf

Women value the ability to provide economically in a long-term mate. Females in a wide variety of species (insects, birds, mammals) prefer males with resources, and the same is true for humans. Buss’s cross-cultural questionnaire study of 37 societies showed that women in all of them placed a higher value on the financial prospects of a prospective mate than men did. Closer questioning of an American sample showed that women prefer immediate access to resources when seeking short-term matings but place greater value on cues to future resource acquisition when evaluating long-term mates. If women act on these stated preferences we would expect wealthy men to have more mates, and there is ample cross cultural evidence that they do. The importance of resources to women is apparent even in egalitarian societies such as the Ache and the Sharanahua, where the best hunters are able to attract the most sexual partners.

Alphas get all - Sexually successful/sexually experienced men are perceived as sexier
http://digital.library.okstate.edu/etd/umi-okstate-2649.pdf

Mate poaching is a robust phenomenon, and it is here to stay. When single women see a moderately attractive male, they are more interested in him if they believe he is already in a relationship! In fact, one sizable study found 90 percent of single women were interested in a man who they believed was taken, while a mere 59 percent wanted him when told he was single.

Study shows that once a women 'bonds' or knows she has fully secured her mates commitment she will lose interest in sex. But women, he said, have evolved to have a high sex drive when they are initially in a relationship in order to form a ""pair bond"" with their partner. But, once this bond is sealed a woman's sexual appetite declines, he added.

How ovulation affects what women find attractive: she wants Alphas when she’s ovulating, betas when she’s not
http://www.livescience.com/8779-fertile-women-manly-men.html

Ovulating women prefer alpha fucks, non-ovulating women prefer beta bucks. A new study reveals that heterosexual women whose partners have less-masculine faces report more attraction to other men during ovulation. Women with masculine-looking partners said their eyes wander less, perhaps because the traits women tend to find sexy when they're fertile are already present in their partners.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1617143/

Here, we show that women in the fertile phase of their cycle prefer body odor of males who score high on a questionnaire-based dominance scale (international personality items pool). In accordance with the theory of mixed mating strategies, this preference varies with relationship status, being much stronger in fertile women in stable relationships than in fertile single women.

http://www.psy.unipd.it/~pbressan/papers/BressanStranieri2008.pdf

In this study, 208 women rated the attractiveness of men described as single or attached. As predicted, partnered women favored attached men at the low-fertility phases of the menstrual cycle, but preferred single men (if masculine, i.e., advertising good genetic quality) when conception risk was high. Because men of higher genetic quality tend to be poorer partners and parents than men of lower genetic quality, women may profit from securing a stable investment from the latter, while obtaining good genes via extrapair mating with the former.

Men with more masculine facial features are more likely to report having been unfaithful in the past (Rhodes et al., 2012) More masculine, taller men are also more likely to divorce and remarry than their shorter counterparts (Mueller and Mazur, 2001). Researchers suggest that some women may pursue a mixed mating strategy, choosing a man with more feminine features as a long-term mate, while pursuing more masculine men for short-term sexual relationships (Cousins, 2015).

Homosexual men reported arousal at male-male and female-male but not female-female or animal. Their physical measurements also matched their words.
Women, of both sexual orientations, displayed physical arousal at the sight of ALL images and videos regardless of their self-reports. It seems that what women’s unconscious sexual instinct wants and what their conscious side wants are very different things.

• The majority of perpetrators of domestic violence are men. Perpetrators are often young, troubled, unemployed, and of low self-esteem; they have often experienced abuse (of various types) themselves.
http://www.reachofclaycounty.org/domestic-violence
• Many abusers suffer from low self-esteem, and their sense of self and identity is tied to their partner. Therefore, if abusers feel they are somehow losing the victim, either through separation, divorce, emotional detachment, or pregnancy (fearing victims will replace love for them with love for a child), they will lash out. If victims ""leave"" through any of these methods, abusers feel they are losing power, control, and their self-identity. Many victims describe domestic violence perpetrators as having a ""Jekyll and Hyde"" personality. Abusers often experience dramatic mood swings of highs and lows. They may be loving one minute, and spiteful and cruel the next. Abusers are frequently characterized by those outside the home as generous, caring, and good, and behave drastically differently in their home environment. Perpetrators of domestic violence are rarely violent to those outside of their domicile.

• The prevalence, age of onset, and symptomatology of many neuropsychiatric conditions differ between males and females. Gaussian-process regression coordinate-based meta-analysis was used to examine sex differences in voxel-based regional volume and density. On average, males have larger total brain volumes than females. Examination of the breakdown of studies providing total volumes by age categories indicated a bias towards the 18–59 year-old category. Regional sex differences in volume and tissue density include the amygdala, hippocampus and insula, areas known to be implicated in sex-biased neuropsychiatric conditions. Together, these results suggest candidate regions for investigating the asymmetric effect that sex has on the developing brain, and for understanding sex-biased neurological and psychiatric conditions.

• Following recall of a conflict involving direct aggression and role-playing a reaction to it, compared with men, women reported their anger would dissipate less quickly and they would take longer to reconcile. Women also exhibited increased heart rate, but little change in cortisol, whereas men exhibited little change in heart rate but increased cortisol production. We interpret the results as indicating that women are less prepared than men to resolve a conflict with a same-sex peer.

• Here, we develop and explore the hypothesis that the norms and institutions that compose the modern package of monogamous marriage have been favored by cultural evolution because of their group-beneficial effects—promoting success in inter-group competition. In suppressing intrasexual competition and reducing the size of the pool of unmarried men, normative monogamy reduces crime rates, including rape, murder, assault, robbery and fraud, as well as decreasing personal abuses.

• Women engage in indirect aggression and slut-shaming, even in clinical research studies. In his book, The Evolution of Desire: Strategies of Human Mating, Buss argues that women do this because, evolutionarily, women who are willing to have casual sex undermine the goals of women who want long-term relationships. ""Slutty"" women hint to men that it’s okay not to commit because there will always be someone available to give away the milk for free, as it were. Their peers' “derogation” is thus intended to damage the reputation of these free-wheeling females.

http://faculty.washington.edu/hechter/KanazawaPaper.pdf
• The evolutionary psychological perspective on wars suggests that the ultimate cause of all intergroup conflict is the relative availability of reproductive women. Polygyny, which allows some men to monopolize all reproductive opportunities and exclude others, should increase the prevalence of civil wars, but not interstate wars, which did not exist in the ancestral environment. The analysis of the Correlates of War data supports both hypotheses derived from the evolutionary psychological perspective; polygyny increases civil wars but not interstate wars. The evolutionary psychological perspective implies that women should be far less resistant to alien rule than men, because they have the option of marrying into the conquering group; however, this sex difference should disappear when women are no longer reproductive. The analysis of the Eurobarometer data from 15 European Union nations strongly confirms this prediction.

• Men and women have more sex when they follow gender norms in the household. This study investigates the links between men’s participation in core (traditionally female) and non-core (traditionally male) household tasks and sexual frequency. Results show that both husbands and wives in couples with more traditional housework arrangements report higher sexual frequency, suggesting the importance of gender display rather than marital exchange for sex between heterosexual married partners.

• Benevolent sexism makes men more attractive to women. German female students (total N = 326) rated the likability and typicality of male targets: a nonsexist, a benevolent sexist, a hostile sexist, and (in Studies 2 and 3) an ambivalent sexist. When targets were presented as response profiles in the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (Glick and Fiske 1996) (Studies 2 and 3), the benevolent sexist was rated to be most likable but least typical, whereas the ambivalent sexist was rated to be highly typical. Thus, women were aware of a link between benevolent and hostile sexism and approved of men’s benevolent sexism.

• Since the women's liberation movement of the 1970s, female happiness has on average declined. The paradox of women’s declining relative well-being is found across various datasets, measures of subjective wellbeing, and is pervasive across demographic groups and industrialized countries. Relative declines in female happiness have eroded a gender gap in happiness in which women in the 1970s typically reported higher subjective well-being than did men. These declines have continued and a new gender gap is emerging − one with higher subjective well-being for men.

Morality Is Ironically Why Society Is Corrupt and Degeneracy is Flourishing,Blackpill,BlkPillPres,"Dec 3, 2018",38000,157,"The ideal society would be driven primarily by logic. I think the reason society is so immoral is ironically because we are trying to be moral and not logical.

The basis of all laws that are good for a society, is logic.

Take murder for example, the law should not be ""you should not kill because its bad/evil"", it should be - ""you should not kill because you also do not want to be killed"". We should hate murder as a society because if we allow other people to kill others haphazardly, then we might be next, sounds fucked up but if society ran on cold logic like that, then everything would be more peaceful.

Basing laws on morality is ironically why society is flawed, its because MORALITY IS SUBJECTIVE. Even criminal organizations like the Yakuza or the Italian Mob, etc all have ""codes of honour"", that are things that even the average citizen would agree with. They have their own set of morals, for example the Mob usually doesn't allow killing women and children, its an emotional and subjective ""rule"", they have let their emotions create an illogical ruleset, but ironically they can kill men, steal from families, sell drugs, etc.

This is the problem with morals, everybody thinks their moral code is ""good enough"". If we all had to operate on logic, there is no such thing as ""my logic"" or ""your logic"", a choice either is logical or it isn't, logic is based on whats objective, not on how something makes one feel. We need a logical society not a moral one, ""true morals"" are inherent to logic, because logic usually yields the greatest collective rule set

Imagine how much the rates of rape and human trafficking would go down of prostitution was decriminalized, think about it, its completely illogical that paying for sex is illegal, there's no logical reason why it should be, yet despite all the income it would generate for a country if taxable, despite all the people it would alleviate from suffering, society keeps it illegal due to moral reasoning.

You see that slut on instagram, a lot of you moralfags on this site would say that she is being immoral, but you would be wrong. She doesn't kill, she doesn't steal, she doesn't <insert ""bad"" thing here>. That's her morals, as far as she's concerned ""the times have changed"" and she can be a slut and ""it isn't hurting anyone"". She is completely moral FOR THE ERA SHE EXISTS IN.

Again MORALS ARE SUBJECTIVE, they change from person to person, country to country, era to era. Morals are pointless, we need to be driven by logic not morals, morals can be altered and therefore THEY CAN BE CORRUPTED.

You can't corrupt logic, you can't corrupt objectivity. It always is what its going to be, it will never change, any changes to a law based on logic, will also be logical, but changes to a ""moral code"" can easily become corrupted.

In fact modern society is the greatest example of this, Christians influenced laws using their moral code, that's why gay marriage was illegal, today morals have been changed due to EMOTIONAL ARGUMENTS. People against gay marriage are seen as ""bigots"", ""evil"", etc. Now today gay marriage is legal.

ANY LAW WITH A FOUNDATION BASED ON EMOTION, IS ""STRUCTURALLY WEAK"" AND CAN BE ALTERED USING EMOTIONS.

MORALS CORRUPT A SOCIETY, THEY DON'T HELP IT"
Found a super old book basically saying what we are saying,Untagged,Fiddlesticks03,"Aug 5, 2019",29000,69,"It is called

Women As Sex Vendors - or, Why Women Are Conservative (Being a View of the Economic - Status of Woman)

It was written in 1918 by Roscoe Tobias and Mary Marcy. Literally no one in the manosphere has heard of it.

some quotes:





“The psychology of the sexes in youth is totally different. The ideas of the average young man are those of one who expects to become some day a producer or at least a worker; the ideas of the average young woman are those of one who expects and intends (for here, too, Youth sees only personal victory) to rise into the leisure, non-producing or supported class.“

“The young man expects to accomplish something in the world, to earn much money, or ""high position,"" in order to be able to marry the most charming girl. The ""most charming girl,"" if she be temporarily forced to earn her own living, expects to find somebody who will marry her, give her more luxuries than she has been accustomed to, and lift her far above her companions. She hopes to become a member of the leisure class even if she never attains it.“

“Women are potential parasites even if they never become real ones, and this is the gist of the matter we are discussing. Why are nearly all small farmers reactionary, individualistic, distrustful, competitive? Because they hope some day to become gentleman farmers. Why are most small business men narrow, egoistic, conservative? For the reason that they hope one day to become men of Big Business. The young woman in America today possesses the same psychology. Being young, she not only hopes, she expects, to rise into the leisure class when some young man asks her for the privilege of supporting her through life.“

“Women, as a sex, are the owners of a commodity vitally necessary to the health and well-being of man“ “As a sex, women occupy a position similar to the petty shop-keeper, because they possess a commodity to sell or to barter. Men, as a sex, are buyers of, or barterers for, this commodity.“

“[Man] has four vital needs to satisfy while woman has only three, and woman possesses, for barter, for sale, or for gift, the wherewithall to satisfy one of these.“

“The more economic power a group, or a class, or a sex possesses, the more the state throws the mantle of its protective laws about it. Women are owners of a commodity for which men are buyers or barterers, and our modern laws protect woman at the expense of man.“

“The beautiful woman sees no need for intelligence nor for understanding because she has always been able to outstrip her less attractive competitors in making the best match and securing the rich husbands. And so her neurones rarely ""connect,"" or react, except to stimuli pertaining to things that will enhance her charms and increase her selling price.“

“That there are [virtually] no women hoboes in the civilized world today is, [...] incontestable proof of the superiority of the economic status of woman over man”.

“Men love to [..] provide [women] with luxurious surroundings, because this advertises to the world the fact that they are able to purchase a superior, i. e., a higher priced commodity“

“Why, do you imagine, the woman who brings to a penniless husband, not only herself but a fortune as well, is looked down upon in many countries? [...] Is it not because both are unconsciously violating the code, or the trade ""understandings,"" in giving not only of themselves, but their substance as well? These women are selling below the market, or scabbing on the job.“

"When you get to your late 20s, early 30s as virgin, you might stay that way your whole life (especially if it's not by choice).",Brutal,Edmund_Kemper,"Nov 11, 2021",40000,191,"I looked at CDC data from 2006-2008 (before the average of virginity rised a little). Of men ages 25-29, 3.8% have never engaged in any sexual contact with the opposite sex, compared to 3.1% of men ages 30-34, 1.3% of men ages 35-39, and 1.2% of men ages 40-44. This means 92.3% of men who never had any sexual contact in their late 30s will remain that way in their 40s! 34.21% of men who never engaged in any sexual contact by their older 20s will stay that way in their late 30s and 42% of men who never engaged in any sexual contact by ages 30-34 will stay that way in their late 30s. Of the ones who stay this way in their late 30s, only 7.7% will lose it by their early 40s. Among those who had 0 sexual partners (meaning no vaginal intercourse partners), 45% of men who had 0 sex partners in their early 30s still don't in their late 30s, and only 7% of the ones in their late 30s find a sex partner by their early 40s. 36.84% of those with 0 sex partners by their older 20s won't have any partners by their late 30s.

On the other hand, among women ages 25-29 who are virgins (3.4% of them), 55.88% stay that way at age 30-34 (compared to 81.58% of male virgins in their older 20s). 47.37% of women who are virgins in their early 30s stay that way in their later 30s. But guess what? Of female virgins in their older 30s, 44.44% stay that way by their early 40s compared to almost 93% of male virgins in their older 30s. This means only 21% of female virgins in their early 30s stay that way in their early 40s and only 11.76% of female virgins in their older 20s stay that way at 40.

There's slightly more male virgins than female virgins in older 20s (3.8% vs 3.4%), whereas in early 30s, male virgins are more common (3.1% vs 1.9%) and in older 30s, 1.4% of men and 0.9% of women are virgins and 1.3% of men and 0.4% of women are virgins. Even in ages 20-24, there were more male than female virgins (12.6% of women that age and 14.4% of men that age).

And remember, the men who lost their virginity late probably were virgins by choice or waiting until marriage or maybe used hookers. Among involuntary virgins, the odds they stayed that way at 40 might be much higher because virgins by choice managed to still have seduction skills.

"Roundup of Thailand Trip - girls, advice, conversation screenshots etc",LifeFuel,itsOVER,"Mar 11, 2018",136000,440,"OK so as promised, here's my roundup of the trip and a step by step guide for any hopecels out there. If you're a fully committed rotter I can respect that but it's probably not the thread for you. This is gonna be a long thread, be warned.

Background: Stayed in Thailand for 22 days. Fucked 10 girls including two 17 year old JB's, none of them hookers. Here's how you can do it too...

How much does this all cost?

I started the holiday with 1,000 GBP ($1400), and was pretty much fully spent up by the end of the trip. This figure includes the cost of accommodation but does not include flights. For the cheapest flights from whereever you live, check out skyscanner.net. For what it's worth, my return flight cost 400 GBP ($550). It's always cheaper if you book a fair few weeks in advance, so do that.

For currency exchange, bring cash to Thailand, and exchange it at the exchange booths there. Do not exchange money at the airport, the rate is shit. In Bangkok there's plenty of exchange shops and you'll only lose like half a percent, which beats withdrawing money at ATM's.

Where should I stay?

For the best chance of slaying non-pro girls, you can't beat Bangkok IMO. You'll be a rarer commodity as a foreigner in Northern towns, but these places are more difficult to function in if you don't speak Thai, and are much more conservative in culture. If you're there a long time and want a quality girlfriend, you could check these places out, but for a short trip, just go to Bangkok.

You want to be staying at a place near a BTS/MRT station (very important), and as close to the centre of town as your budget allows (less important, but it helps). For reference, the absolute 'centre' is the Siam BTS station, so be as near to there as reasonably possible. 

I personally stayed at this place: https://www.aiyapurabangkok.com/ . It was close to the BTS, but around 25 minutes from the centre. The cost was 9,800 baht ($310), plus the electric bill at the end came to 2,000 ($64) baht.

Photos of the exact room I stayed at are here: 

Anything else?

You're gonna want a SIM card when in Thailand. You can choose between AIS, DTAC, and True (these are phone providers in Thailand). I personally used DTAC, but any will work fine. Make sure you buy a decent data package - you want 5 GB of data for a 2 week trip minimum IMO. It's fairly cheap. Don't worry about call or text credit as everyone uses a messeging app here called LINE, which only uses data. Just walk into one of these stores and they'll sort you out.

For transport, do yourself a favour and buy a 'rabbit card' for the BTS. You'll be travelling a lot to meet various girls, and the card gets you cheaper trips. It drops the cost from an average of 44 baht per trip to 31 - this adds up when you're traveling a lot.

For food, it's entirely up to you. I ate mostly Thai food which is an average of 40 baht ($1.30) a meal on the street. You can get decent food in mall food courts for around 60 baht ($2). If you want to eat at fancy high priced western restaurants than the sky is the limit, but unless you're a richcel don't do that.

In general things are much cheaper outside the malls. Food, clothes, medicines etc. 

Enough of this bullshit, get to the girls already!

How you do even meet them? Do I have to cold approach or go clubbing alone like some TRP moron?

No you don't.

I met all the girls online. Tinder was 70% of the lays. Other apps possible are badoo and skout. You can also try thaifriendly.com although I've found tinder is significantly better for getting quick lays.

I don't have much success getting the girls to meet in my room straight away. It happened, but only twice. YMMV if you are more attractive than me (or less attractive). In general I think the average PSL 4 guy is gonna have to meet the girl outside the room, then try and get her back there at some point.

I don't know how to speak to girls online - how do you get them to meet up?

Don't overcomplicate it. Have 4 or 5 messages on tinder, then ask for her LINE ID. Once there, carry on talking a bit about BS stuff (school, work, hobbies etc, the usual shit). Then ask her when she's free, and arrange a meet. 

IMPORTANT: If she is hesitant, or says 'maybe' she's free on xxx date, or says 'not sure' or anything else like that, it's OVER, move on. SEA girls are massive timewasters so you have to be harsh when cutting them out here. Any hint of being a timewaster = cut her loose. Don't spend large amounts of time on any one girl, it's pointless. If they like you, they'll meet quickly.

Here's some screenshots of conversations with girls I banged to show you how it's done:

First example:

Second example:

https://imgur.com/a/L0ScM

Third example (one of the JB's - if you look closely you can see she changed her profile pic to me and her):

https://imgur.com/a/NpMt3


Hopefully you can all see it's not really that complicated. Find out when they're free, arrange a meetup. Easy.

Where to go for first dates?

Pick somewhere reasonably close to your room, but also keep in mind the girls location. If she's on the other side of Bangkok to you, meet in the middle. Don't travel long distances to meet a girl as SEA girls are notorious timewasters - they only actually turn up around 75% of the time in my experience, and 90% of those times they're late. You also want a location reasonably close to your room to make it easier to get the girl back there.

There's no difference in success rate when doing something expensive vs something cheap, so just do something cheap. Stuff that worked for me this trip - getting an ice cream together, going for a walk in the park, going to a cheapish restaurant for food. I did also get laid twice by arranging to meet girls at clubs, but there's no increase in success rate going clubbing vs doing something cheaper.

Don't expect to succeed all the time. It's a lot easier in Thailand, but you're not gonna bang the girl every single time in my experience. YMMV if you're more or less attractive than me, as usual.

So how do you get the girl back to your room?

The usual method is you do whatever you've arranged to do (park, ice cream etc), then you suggest going to watch a movie in your room. Do NOT tell her you're going back there to have sex. If a Thai girl comes back to your room, 90% of the time she's willing to fuck you, I've literally only failed with a Thai girl once when I've got her back to my room.

But itsOVER, the majority of these girls are below average or downright ugly?

That's right buddy boyo, and as an incel you don't have the luxury of choice. Bang, or volcel it is.

On a more serious note, I agree most were not that attractive. That was a function of my general strategy however - I was going for the maximum slays possible, so was focused on numbers, not quality. Getting a 'quality' girl is much easier when you actually live there, as you have the time to do the 3 date thing then bang her. It doesn't take long to get a quality PSL 5+ chick, just a couple of weeks normally, but that's time you don't have when you're only there a few weeks. If you want better looking girls, I suggest you either:

1) Be better looking than me.
2) Start considering ways you can live permanently in SEA. I got MUCH better girls when I lived there.
3) Go to Manila where I hear it's even easier.
4) Escortcel.

With that said, I think girl number 3 was decent, girl 6 was OK, and girls 4, 8 and 9 were fuckable enough. Girls 1, 2 and 7 were definitely on the dodgy side, especially 7, although I was kinda reverse catfished there and it was a case of bang or go home and wank. Girls 6 and 8 were haloed a bit by being 17 year old JB's. The rest were just below average but not downright awful. 

Keep in mind even Chad doesn't fuck prime Stacy's all the time - that's why so many of you whine on here that you can't get your looksmatch. Chad has to fuck plenty of sub-prime roast beef too. 

I've still got more questions?

[Tinder Experiment] Ugly gymcel gets hot Tinder matches! [Spicy thread] [GTFIH],Untagged,Framecel222,"Jan 14, 2018",107000,485,"I've made a lot of truly impressive and ingenious posts on here, but this might be my greatest post yet. ITT I will single-handedly end the ""does gymcelling work?"" debate.

The profile: 






That's right, I used the infamous horsefacecel for this experiment. I swiped right on every girl for 10 days (I was going to do two weeks until I saw my oneitis on Tinder, causing me to have a complete mental breakdown and forcing me to stop the experiment early.) So let's look at the facts"" we've got a guy with a 2.5/10 face, he has ONE picture, presumably average height, and no real content in the bio. If you TRULY believe that physique doesn't matter, you will expect him to get zero matches besides an odd landwhale or goblin shark here and there, right? Well my friends, feast your eyes upon this.

The results:





















There is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY he would get this level of results if he had an average physique. I would go as far as saying this experiment is indisputable proof that physique matters. Not as much as face of course, because someone with an 8/10 face and a 2.5/10 body would get infinitely better results. Still, this definitely shows that gymcelling and roidcelling DO WORK.

Now let's all take tren and ascend (manlets need not apply.)

tl;dr hideous roidcel gets hot Tinder matches and Framecel ends the gymcelling debate once and for all.

"HALO EFFECT - Victimized employees are seen as bullies despite exemplary performance, actual bullies get a pass",Untagged,Gymcelled,"Jan 30, 2021",18000,120,"There's an article that covers this paper, i'll copy paste some important parts.

tl;dr Victims of workplace mistreatment may also be seen as bullies themselves, even if they've never engaged in such behavior, and despite exemplary performance. Bullies, on the other hand, may be given a pass if they are liked by their supervisor. There is a bias toward victim blaming.

""The results are eye-opening,"" Taylor says. ""I think they are useful because, given all of these accounts in the media of bad behavior happening, people are often left wondering how can we blame victims, and why do we let these perpetrators off the hook, why do they go unpunished?""

 @Atavistic Autist You were right when you said psychopaths succeed in today's world.

Taylor attributes the flawed decision making to cognitive biases, such as the halo effect, in which positive attributes mask negative traits, or the horns effect, in which one negative attribute casts a person in a completely negative light.

The researchers performed their work over the course of four studies. The first two studies showed through surveys of employees and supervisors that supervisors tend to view victims of bullying as being bullies themselves.

Studies three and four were experiments where participants evaluated employees based on descriptions of their work performance, as well as how they treated others and how they were treated.

They found that even when evaluators were clearly informed that a victim did not mistreat others, victims were still seen as bullies. In the fourth study, they found that not only are victims seen as bullies despite evidence to the contrary, but also that they receive lower job performance evaluations as a result of being victimized.

 Your behavior doesn't fucking matter. Jfl at people using the just world fallacy these days, like we live in a social meritocracy 

The researchers found support in all four studies that bullies were less likely to be seen as deviant when their supervisor considered them to be good performers. 

People get away with treating others like absolute shit. Reminds me of when a kid is bullied at school, he's beaten and mocked all day, grows up scarred and insecure. People will tell him that HIS social skills were bad and the social skills of his bullies were GOOD. Psychopaths who torture you are seen as socially apt, if not outright gifted. What does this say about society?

The two Canadian studies may go some way to explaining why celebrity bullies like Gordon Ramsay are a hit with women - even though they have explosive tempers.
Simon Fraser University criminologist Jennifer Wong surveyed 135 teenagers from a high school in Vancouver with a questionnaire about bullying. The pupils were asked how often they were hit, kicked or shoved and from that they were divided into categories; bully, bystander, victim or victim-bully. The results showed that bullies, who accounted for around 11 per cent of the group, scored highest when it came to social status and self-esteem. They also came lowest when it came to depression.

Copeland and his colleagues took advantage of a database involving 1420 children who were followed from the age of 9 to 21, and who were tested at nine different times during that period. They were asked about their bullying experiences, and researchers took their blood to measure things like C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker for inflammation that is an important for predictor of heart disease, among other ailments. Victims of bullying showed the greatest increases in their CRP levels, compared to where they started, which wasn’t surprising, since inflammation can spike due to stress, anxiety, and lack of sleep—all of which bullying victims experience. The more often victims were bullied, the more their CRP levels rose. But the real shocker came when the scientists analyzed the CRP levels of the bullies. Their inflammation rates were lower even than those children who had never reported being bullied or being a bully. Bullying seemed to protect the aggressors from inflammatory diseases. “We found that the enhanced social status that came along with being a bully did seem to advantage them over time,” says Copeland. “That finding more than anything else surprised us.”

"Thailand is not forever, Thaimax now or the door closes",Theory,Zhou Chang-Xing,"Mar 5, 2023",8000,62,"Zoomercels don't really know about this and will likely read this with strong disbelief, but only a few generations ago the Kingdom of Sweden was not too different from what the Kingdom of Thailand is now, men from developed countries would go there to find a hot young wife he could only dream of in his own country. Swedish toilets who were young, with large breasts, curvy figures, long blonde hair, blue eyes, and a cute little accent were so easy to come by, even an ugly Black or Pakistani man could easily get one, in fact it was kind of a stereotype that Swedish toilets prefer Black and Brown men, in that era the meme was ""JBB"" (Just be Brown) with Swedish toilets. 

If one looks at older cinema it is a common trope for a nerdy loser virgin with terrible acne to go to Sweden and reject a lot of Stacy's to go home with a Nordic Giga-Stacy. Such stories were hardly an exaggeration as I've met multiple older toilets in my youth who were Swedish toilets that migrated to the Netherlands to be with their husbands. Swedemaxxing is such a common trope in older cinema that it's a given that an ugly incel in the country the film is set in will go to Sweden and come home with a Giga-Stacy or even a harem of Giga-Stacy's. 

This all sounds like fantasy today, Swedish toilets are in such high demand that the idea of even getting a Swedish wife as an immigrant is an unrealistic fantasy. 

http://web.archive.org/web/20230305...belbrides.com/european-brides/swedish-brides/ 

Sure, Swedish mail order brides still exist and they are (as far as I know) the only Non-Eastern European White majority country with them, but this is just a rudimentary leftover of a bygone era. 

When I was young Swedish massage parlours sprinkled the streets and Swedish brides of indigenous men ran them, but as I got older these Swedish massage parlours started disappearing and another type soon emerged... The Thai massage parlour. 

I have written before that one reason why JBW works is the scarcity of White men in places like Thailand and Cambodia, in rural Mindanao some of my female friends talked about only occasionally seeing the old bald pasty White there to pick up his hot young Pinay bride. Whenever a White man passes they know that he's a high value male and in demand, no matter what a loser he is in his own land. 

While Sweden was a developed and wealthy society during the era of cheap Swedish pussy and Swedemaxxing, the Philippines and Thailand aren't dirt poor today either, even poorer Thai people in Bangkok live relatively decent lives. 


View: https://youtube.com/shorts/RARkOwNW5dE?feature=share


Some users on this forum believe in ""JBB"" and this White toilet cheated on her White husband with multiple Black police officers. 










Most of the men here are Sub-5 Blackcels, this is her husband. 





Plenty of young men on this forum would call any instance of a White toilet with a non-White man (especially an ugly one) ""pure cope"" and the opposite as ""proof of JBW"", as if White toilets are 100% loyal to their race and all non-White toilets masturbate to White men. But older incels might remember a time when they met several Black men who went to Sweden and West Germany to find wives, in fact the Black American man with a White Swedish or West German toilet was kind of a meme and several prominent Black athletes today have Swedish or West German mothers. 

The reality is that if you're scarce on a market and the demand is higher than the supply you're going to have a good time. 

So, what happened to Sweden? While before as a Brown or Black man you could easily score far above your looksmatch in Sweden it might be easy to blame the collapse of the Swedish xenophilic fetish market on the tsunami of immigrants that have entered the Kingdom since the 1990's... As you were once a scarce product and if a Swedish toilet had a fetish for dark skin and curly hair such men would be hard to find, but the reality is that the presence of immigrants themselves are a symptom of what made Swedemaxxing a thing of the past. 

This is none other than Mercer's Demographics Blackpill. 


View: https://youtu.be/gpYJzd7JOb8


Sweden's indigenous population has been below replacement rate for decades, this is why they panicked and imported immigrants like crazy in order to keep the welfare state and pensions up, decades later this proved to be a stupid decision, but the way populations work is that it's a pyramid scheme. Baby Boomers had tonnes of sex because they were an enormous boom in the population, but ever since them the pyramid has been reversing. 

In fact, Sweden and Japan were both on equal footing for finding wives back in the day, the goofy Japanese wife is as much as an old trope as the hot Swedish wife. 

Today a lot of men make it their pension plan to go to Thailand, to go to the Philippines, to go to Vietnam, to go to Indonesia. You'll see old ugly White men say things like ""Man, I really love Thailand for the culture"", ""I am retiring here in Vietnam for the laid back and easy going culture"", and ""I am tiring to the Philippines because of their Christian values"". They are only there for the pussy. 

SEAmaxxing works great today, but Thailand's fertility numbers are below replacement rate, Vietnam's fertility numbers are below replacement rate, the Philippines' fertility numbers are below replacement rate, Indonesia's fertility numbers are below replacement rate, Etc. 

SEAmaxxing will not be an option in the future like how Japmaxxing and Swedemaxxing aren't today. Deutschmaxxing has long been replaced by Slavmaxxing for the man of colour who wants cheap White pussy, but Eastern Europe's fertility numbers have been low long before Thailand's for decades which is why Slavmaxxing is more costly than Thaimaxxing, despite Thailand being wealthier than many Eastern European shitholes. 

Medicann Blackpill (where the above video is hosted) is a channel by a Slav who went Thaimaxxing and praises Thailand. 

If you're a younger Zoomer reading this now, Thailand is a window that won't be open when you're my age, you can work on your career and gather the money only to find out that when you're 30 you can only get out-of-shape 50 year old Thai pussy and not the nice 20 year old gymmaxxed tight pussy that Millennial incels and older Zoomer incels were coping with to ascend. 

Soon Afromaxxing, Iraqmaxxing, and Afghanmaxxing will be THE ONLY viable options, Thailand will be flooded by foreigners looking for pussy but not enough pussy due to a declining birth rate that started over a decade ago. 

If history is a teacher it's that you can't take cheap pussy for granted when it's in abundance, once it's gone it stays gone. PewDiePie is a blonde hair, blue eyed Chad and even he had to cope with being single, alone, and depressed in Sweden. He had to go Spaghettimaxxing to get a wife he could never have gotten in the Kingdom of Sweden. 





This was Sweden in the 1970's. Even for Indian standards that man is absolutely beyond ugly. She's a 4/10 which is way above his looks level. He's so ugly, if he went to Australia people would assume that he's an Aboriginal, yet he could still find pussy in Sweden. 

Thailand, historically speaking, was not the exception, it was the rule. Then Western toilets stopped having lots of babies, then East Asian toilets stopped having lots of babies, SEA remained and Thailand became THE Incel haven. 

But history tells us that once the demographic shift happens pussy longer stays affordable. 

This is a historical time to go Thaimaxxing and Pinaymaxxing. 

The Blackpill is quickly becoming mainstream, I've seen a number of Blackpill videos with over a million views I've even met middle aged toilets in rural villages that have heard of incels and our related glossary. As the Blackpill becomes more mainstream more White men realise that they have to go to Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines to find a wife. As the supply of young toilets isn't being refilled due to low birth numbers and a huge influx of East Asian men looking for wives in the same region is occuring the demand will soon outnumber the supply. 

The early symptom of this would be incels from this forum going to Thailand and coming back with 0 action and having absolutely nothing to show for it. Or them reporting having a harder time at it. 

JBW is just a cope beyond the fact that a small number of Asian toilets have a White fetish. There's this idea that all Asian toilets worship White men and White features, but I have talked to several Asian toilets with a fetish for Black men: 





This is a Pinay who friendzoned me, while she gives me compliments on some of my (African) features whenever I show her a person Blacker than me she goes wild. I know a Vietnamese toilet who loves watching Blacked videos and married a Nigger. This is a pale skinned Pinay with a skin other Filipina's would envy, and she wants to throw her pale skin genetics away for an African. 

(Also, obviously I'm an Atheist, I just go Catholicmaxxing to try and gain their trust, Filipina's tend to be very traditional and conservative and hold Christianity and Christian values as something to uphold, Christianity and Tradwives disgusts me, but Asian pussy is so hot that I'm willing to pretend to be a pious Tradhusband and de-programme the Christian brain-washing later, this is unfortunately the price a Socialist Atheist Jew like myself would have to pay for Pinay pussy). 

The ability to find a market where you're in demand now is easy, Thailand exists, Vietnam exists, the Philippines exist. An obese Black friend of mine told me about being approached in the streets by skinny highly educated Hanoian toilet, this would literally NEVER happen outside of the walls of Hanoi. 

The reality is that the fertility rates of all these countries is too low to be sustainable, Ukrainian toilets who live in poverty worse than anywhere in Thailand still price themselves higher because young toilets are simply rarer. Poverty isn't why pussy is cheap, the literal abundance of pussy is. 

Either you will go to Thailand now and find your dream Thai wife or you'll be doomed to end up alone in a future Thailand where pussy has become rarer than diamonds. 

The door has been slowly closing for years now, when I first joined the forum a 5'1 man complained about Bangkok being infested with hoards of 6'6 young White men with six-packs, he then talked about going outside of Bangkok and disappeared from this forum. He ascended, but even outside of Bangkok the fertility numbers are too low. 

Soon SEAmaxxing will be a relic of the past. 

I'm planning on going to the Philippines this year, install Tinder there, and see what I can get. Every year you wait you'll find that the game is going to get more difficult and even impossible if you miss the boat. 

Don't miss the boat, hop on it RIGHT NOW."
The FBI defeated us in a very insidious way,Theory,YuiStillMyCope,"Feb 14, 2023",22000,152,"I’m not the first person to suggest this, see:








Are we being manipulated by the FBI?


It's well known that fbi and other government organizations cooperate with big tech to censor/influence public opinions, such is the case of ""twitter files"" where fauci forced twitter to censor ""misinformation"". Also, reddit and many other sites have highly intelligent bots pushing for opinions...




incels.is




But I think the FBI derails discussion here because they see us as a threat

COINTELPRO (you can skip this part it’s just copied from Wikipedia)
So starting from 1956 the FBI ran a series of illegal projects called COINTELPRO that was “aimed at surveilling, infiltrating, discrediting, and disrupting domestic American political organisations”. They targeted civil rights activists (including sending MLK a letter telling him to kill himself, im not joking), communists, feminists, environmentalists, anti-vietnam war activists, etc., as well as a few right wing organisations like the KKK. Their 5 main tactics were:

Infiltration: Agents and informers did not merely spy on political activists. Their main purpose was to discredit, disrupt and negatively redirect action. Their very presence served to undermine trust and scare off potential supporters. The FBI and police exploited this fear to smear genuine activists as agents.
Psychological warfare: The FBI and police used a myriad of ""dirty tricks"" to undermine movements. They planted false media stories and published bogus leaflets and other publications in the name of targeted groups. They forged correspondence, sent anonymous letters, and made anonymous telephone calls. They spread misinformation about meetings and events, set up pseudo movement groups run by government agents, and manipulated or strong-armed parents, employers, landlords, school officials, and others to cause trouble for activists. They used bad-jacketing to create suspicion about targeted activists, sometimes with lethal consequences.[73]
Harassment via the legal system: The FBI and police abused the legal system to harass dissidents and make them appear to be criminals. Officers of the law gave perjured testimony and presented fabricated evidence as a pretext for false arrests and wrongful imprisonment. They discriminatorily enforced tax laws and other government regulations and used conspicuous surveillance, ""investigative"" interviews, and grand jury subpoenas in an effort to intimidate activists and silence their supporters.[72][74]
Illegal force: The FBI conspired with local police departments to threaten dissidents; to conduct illegal break-ins in order to search dissident homes; and to commit vandalism, assaults, beatings and assassinations.[72] The objective was to frighten or eliminate dissidents and disrupt their movements.
Undermine public opinion:One of the primary ways the FBI targeted organizations was by challenging their reputations in the community and denying them a platform to gain legitimacy. Hoover specifically designed programs to block leaders from ""spreading their philosophy publicly or through the communications media"". Furthermore, the organization created and controlled negative media meant to undermine black power organizations. For instance, they oversaw the creation of ""documentaries"" skillfully edited to paint the Black Panther Party as aggressive, and false newspapers that spread misinformation about party members. The ability of the FBI to create distrust within and between revolutionary organizations tainted their public image and weakened chances at unity and public support.[48]

Now the FBI claims that this ended in 1971, but no one believes them on that. There are many examples of them being confirmed to do it since then. As recently as 2017 their documents show that they were surveilling BLM protestors as “Black Identity Extremists” and doing essentially the same thing to them as COINTELPRO.

Why there are glowies among us
The reason I brought this up is because I think Wikipedia’s description of the FBI’s tactics match up a lot with what’s happening to us.

Their main purpose was to discredit, disrupt and negatively redirect action.
Compare .is as it is now to the r/braincels archive. .is is now far less about inceldom and posting memes and stuff (even in media), and far more about racebait or just hating on women. Granted this is probably part because we’re not on reddit anymore, but I believe it’s also that glowies make these kind of threads (“slide threads” as they’re called on 4chan), since this problem is getting worse and worse

exploited this fear to smear genuine activists as agents
I know this is ironic to say now, but people here get accused of being IT infiltrators/glowies over the tiniest things. This would be normal, but it gets very sus when you get accused of being an imposter for not being racist or supporting pedophilia or something. It’s like glowies are using our fear of glowies to push this change away from inceldom and towards just being a far-right movement.

They planted false media stories
This is obviously happening to incels. The media paints us at these evil alt-right misogynists when we’re really just lonely guys looking for someone to talk to. Recently though we’ve become a bit more like what the media portrayed us as, and as I said this is probably because of glowies influencing this change

The FBI and police abused the legal system to harass dissidents and make them appear to be criminals
This hasn’t officially happened in America yet but it has in Canada and the UK, both of which have legally classified incels as a terrorist group. Now we’re obviously not terrorists; I made another thread about how the average incel kills less than the average American. And if we are terrorists then we’re probably the easiest terrorists to please, considering that all we want is just one woman to love us. I doubt the UK’s prevent scheme is about getting gfs for incels. The point of these “counter terrorism” projects isn’t actually to deradicalise incels, it’s to make us seem like terrorists to the public.

block leaders from ""spreading their philosophy publicly or through the communications media""
The incel subreddits, which were doing a great job at bring attention to incels, were all banned. This could’ve been just reddit’s decision after brigaders kept reporting posts there, or it could’ve been from government pressure too. Either way it worked in their favour. Fortunately they’ve had problems taking down .is because of our Icelandic domain, but they’ll probably do it eventually by pressuring our ISP. They’ll might take down inceltear as well because they’ve been bringing attention to us, or leave it up because they portray us badly

they oversaw the creation of ""documentaries"" skillfully edited to paint the Black Panther Party as aggressive
Obviously happening to us too. I think they’re also using academia by having all those useless incel studies portray us as hateful. One possible reason for this is that it allows them to change the narrative on Wikipedia by abusing the site’s rules. Just look at the history of its incel page and you’ll see what I mean

false newspapers that spread misinformation about party members
Plenty of examples of this too, already mentioned under the “false media stories” bit

TLDR The FBI is COINTELPROing us, and it’s pretty hopeless but we can fight back by going back to how we would post in the r/braincels days. Also we should be mistrustful of anyone who posts non-incel-related things in ID such as racebait"

Loneliness is so devastating that people would rather be around murderers and rapists than be alone. People would rather risk getting shanked or raped, that's how bad loneliness is. 

Forced isolation destroys people's mental health in various ways and even has adverse effects on their physiological health. Some of this mental damage can be permanent. Moreover, the loneliness often leads to self harm and suicide. 


Isolated Insanity: The Damaging Effects of Solitary Confinement Isolate

""Solitary confinement is a popular form of punishment in prisons. However, it often results in the deterioration of the inmate’s mental health, especially when it is prolonged. It may lead to severe mental illness or self-harm, including suicide. In addition to the mental health effects, solitary confinement inhibits the rehabilitation process as it limits or eliminates exercise, visitation hours, medical treatment, and group recreation. Without these, many inmates lose their sense of identity and their hold on reality, thereby reducing the odds of successful reentry into society.""

""Researchers have shown that isolation is a psychological stressor that can become as distressing as physical torture (Metzner & Fellner, 2010), and may be especially damaging in mentally ill prisoners. ""

""Psychological stressors may result in the following: anxiety, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, paranoia, anger, perceptual distortions, psychosis, panic, insomnia, hallucinations, self-mutilation, suicidal behavior, violence, emotional breakdowns, and withdrawal (Andersen, Sestoft, Lillebaek, Gabrielsen, & Hemmingsen, 2003; Grassian, 1983; Haney, 2003; Haney et al., 2016; Metzner & Fellner, 2010; Pizarro & Stenius, 2004; Shalev, 2011)""

""Anderson and colleagues (2003) reported that a higher risk for mental disorders exists in solitary confinement inmates than in those not exposed to solitary confinement.""

""In studies of the psychological consequences of solitary confinement, Haney (2003) utilized both case studies and personal accounts of mental health workers in supermax prisons. He concluded that there is not a single study wherein inmates placed in solitary confinement for more than 10 days did not present negative psychological symptoms (see also, Applebaum, 2015).""

 Imagine what being a social outcast for years or decades must do to you. Imagine what LDAR'ing and neeting for years does to someone

""Due to the mental deterioration associated with solitary confinement, inmates engage in suicidal behavior and self-harm (Arrigo & Bullock, 2008; Haney, 2003). Self-harm is the leading cause of death among inmates ""

 Roping and suicidal tendencies are very common among isolated people ... sound familiar?

""Solitary confinement also inhibits inmates’ rehabilitation. They are denied access to recreation, regular visitation hours, and proper psychiatric treatment (Haney, 2003; Haney et al., 2016; Pizzaro & Stenius, 2004; Shalev, 2011). Without these vital programs that enhance their living state, inmates will often struggle to adapt to regular society upon their release from prison (Haney et al., 2016). ""

Here's a brutal example from the same paper about a teenager who was falsely convicted, placed in isolation, which subsequently destroyed his mental health to the point where his family and friends felt he was off ... this later lead to him roping (literally)



Spoiler: Brutal story



The transformations were illustrated in the case of Kalief, a 16-year-old sent to Rikers Island for allegedly stealing a backpack (Haney et al., 2016). He struggled to adjust to the prison environment and was placed in isolation, where he became increasingly depressed and attempted suicide. After doing so, he spent time in the prison hospital but, upon recovery, was immediately returned to solitary confinement. After three years in prison, the last 17 months in isolation, Kalief was unexpectedly released when a judge decreed that he was innocent. After his release, his friends and family noticed that he was different. He paced around his room and preferred to be alone. He attempted suicide multiple times, and as he continued to struggle with depression and paranoia, he explained, “I’m not all right. I’m messed up. There are certain things that changed about me and they might not go back” (p. 128). He later hanged himself.



Effects of Solitary Confinement on the Well Being of Prison Inmates​""Confined inmates often experience various physiological symptoms, even after a short amount of time in confinement. Isolated inmates often report symptoms similar to those of hypertension, such as chronic headaches, trembling, sweaty palms, extreme dizziness and heart palpitations. (Smith, 2006; Haney, 2003; Shalev, 2008).""

""Inmates also experience trouble with their eating and digestion, especially within the first three months of solitary confinement (Smith, 2006). A lack of appetite and drastic weight loss is often accompanied with irregular digestion, particularly diarrhea. Inmates in isolation may also have difficulty sleeping, and some may experience insomnia (Smith, 2006; Haney, 2003). Consequently,, inmates report feelings of chronic lethargy (Shalev, 2008).""

 Notice how inmates placed in solitary experience the same sleeping issues as lonely people, as previously discussed in this thread i made

""Confined inmates experience a multitude of psychological effects, including emotional, cognitive, and psychosis-related symptoms (Smith, 2006; Shalev, 2008). Solitary confinement is considered harmful to the mental health of inmates because it restricts meaningful social contact, a psychological stimulus that humans need in order to remain healthy and functioning (Smith, 2006). Longer stays in solitary confinement are associated with greater mental health symptoms that have serious emotional and behavioral consequences. (Smith, 2006; Shalev, 2008).""

""Confined prisoners also report feelings of panic and rage, including irritability, hostility, and poor impulse control.""

""Additionally, they frequently exhibit symptoms of anxiety that vary from low levels of stress to severe panic attacks. Isolated inmates also experience symptoms of depression, such as hopelessness, mood swings, and withdrawal. These depressive symptoms may even escalate to thoughts of self-harm and suicide. As compared to the general prison population, rates of suicide and self-harm, such as cutting and banging one’s head against the cell wall, are particularly high in prisoners assigned to solitary confinement (Haney, 2003; Shalev, 2008; Greist, 2012).""

 I think the analogy with this forum is obvious

""Cognitive effects of solitary confinement. In addition to having disruptions in their emotional processes, inmates’ cognitive processes tend to deteriorate while they are in isolation. Some confined inmates report memory loss, and a significant portion of isolated inmates report impaired concentration (Smith, 2006; Shalev, 2008). Many are unable to read or watch television since these activities are their few sources of entertainment. Confined inmates also report feeling extremely confused and disoriented in time and space (Haney, 2003; Shalev, 2008).""

 LDAR'ing rots your brain. This is sort of cognitive/attention span decline has been talked about a lot on this forum by certain users such as @anon1822

""Another confinement related psychological symptom that inmates may experience is disrupted thinking, defined as an inability to maintain a coherent flow of thoughts. This disrupted thinking can result in symptoms of psychosis (Haney, 2003; Shalev, 2008). Inmates who exhibit these symptoms of psychosis often report experiencing hallucinations, illusions, and intense paranoia, such as a persistent belief that they are being persecuted (Shalev, 2008). In extreme cases, inmates have become paranoid to the point that they exhibit full-blown psychosis that requires hospitalization (Smith, 2006).""

 You've been alone for your entire life?? You've never had friends?? Just go out and be confident. Just put yourself out there bro, what do you mean you can't do it?

Solitary Confinement and Mental Illness in U.S. Prisons: A Challenge for Medical Ethics​
""Solitary confinement is recognized as difficult to withstand; indeed, psychological stressors such as isolation can be as clinically distressing as physical torture.1,2""

""Psychological effects can include anxiety, depression, anger, cognitive disturbances, perceptual distortions, obsessive thoughts, paranoia, and psychosis.6""

""They live with extensive surveillance and security controls, the absence of ordinary social interaction, abnormal environmental stimuli, often only three to five hours a week of recreation alone in caged enclosures, and little, if any, educational, vocational, or other purposeful activities (i.e., programs).""

 How much different is this really from the life of some social outcasts?

""The stress, lack of meaningful social contact, and unstructured days can exacerbate symptoms of illness or provoke recurrence.7 Suicides occur disproportionately more often in segregation units than elsewhere in prison.8–10 All too frequently, mentally ill prisoners decompensate in isolation, requiring crisis care or psychiatric hospitalization. Many simply will not get better as long as they are isolated.""

""International treaty bodies and human rights experts, including the Human Rights Committee,18 the Committee against Torture,19,20 and the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture,21 have concluded that solitary confinement may amount to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment in violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights22 and the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading Treatment or Punishment.23""

Psychological Distress in Solitary Confinement: Symptoms, Severity, and Prevalence in the United States, 2017–2018​
Results. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) results showed clinically significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, or guilt among half of our research sample. Administrative data showed disproportionately high rates of serious mental illness and self-harming behavior compared with general prison populations. Interview content analysis revealed additional symptoms, including social isolation, loss of identity, and sensory hypersensitivity.

""In Washington State, interviewers administered the BPRS to a random sample of 87 incarcerated people during qualitative interviews (and also conducted 122 medical chart reviews),1,9,15 concluding that solitary confinement reveals “a concentration of some of the most important negative effects of the entire prison complex.”1(p1692)""

[MULTIPLE STUDIES] The REAL truth about the JBpill (attraction to teens is common). Agecucks will hate this (but so will pedos who like 9 year olds).,Blackpill,Edmund_Kemper,"Dec 20, 2021",27000,123,"Since idiots think it's abnormal to find a 17 year old chick attractive and since there's perverts here (who didn't appear until 2021) who think finding a 9 year old of all people is normal (it ain't), I decided to prove the REAL truth about attraction and age, and both groups of idiots will be debunked with RESEARCH PAPERS.

to all bluepillers reading this, calling me a pedophile isn't an argument. to all people who like 9 year olds, calling me an agecuck isn't an argument (calling attraction to 9 year olds deviant is NOT agecuckery).

Penile Circumference, Skin Conductance, and Ranking Responsesof Child Molesters and ""Normals"" to Sexual and Nonsexual Visual Stimuli

20 child molesters (average age: 27.5 years; who were over 16 at the time of offense and whose victims were age 13 and below), 10 non-sex offending patients (average age: 26.7 years; all non-sex offending patients were heterosexual except one being gay), and 11 normal men from the community (average age: 25; all of the normal men were heterosexual except one bisexual man) were recruited to measure penile circumference and skin conductance response (PCR and SCR) alongside attractiveness rankings.

""In the slide sort test, two arrays of six black and white slides each were shown to the subject, one array at a time, on a lighted sorting tray. A seventh color slide depicting a sado-masochisticact was included in each array. In one array, the black and white figures were nude and, in the other, the figures were partially clothed. There was one representative of each sex at each of three age levels: adult (between 18 and 30 yr of age as judged by the experimenters), pubescent (12-15 yr) and child (5-11 yr). Each subject was asked to choose the slide that he found most sexually attractive and that slide was removed from the tray. This process was repeated until there was no slide left or until the subject reported that he found none of the remaining slides attractive. The ranking data were scored for each subject by ordering the slides within an array according to their order of choice. When not all the slides were chosen, the remaining slides were assigned the average of the remaining ranks. The data from the two arrays were combined by com- puting the average rank of the slides from the same category.

In the psychophysiological test, subjects were seated in the reclining chair and in- structed to relax, look carefully at the slides and think of them in a sexual way. It was explained that the apparatus measured very tiny changes in penile circumference. Subjects were also told that they should avoid unnecessary movement as this would interfere with the measurements. The electrodes were attached and subjects were shown 20 slides in a fixed randomized sequence. Each sfide presentation was 30 sec in duration and was sepa- rated by 60 sec from the next presentation. When a large PCR of long duration occurred, the next slide presentation was delayed until the PCR returned to a steady state near baseline. Full erections sometimes resulted in the PCR polygraph trace going off scale. These traces were scored by giving the subject the maximum reading that the scale allowed.

There were two slides in each of the following categories. In the ""heterosexual activity"" or HET category, a nude or partially clothed man and woman were depicted petting on a bed. In the person categories, there were pictures of single nude or partially clothed persons. The female categories were: ""adult female"" or AF (judged to be between 18 and 30 yr), ""pubescent female"" or PF (12-15 yr of age), and ""child female"", (5-11 yr of age). These age categories were identical in the male series. There were three additional cat- egories: ""children under five"" or C < 5 (one picture of a male toddler and one of a female toddler), ""sadistic"" or SP (a female nurse being choked by a man and a man being whipped by another man), and finally, ""neutral"" or NS (a chandelier and a landscape). None of the slides used in the slide sort were presented in the psychophysiological test in order to preserve novelty.""






Figure 1 shows that normal subjects showed strong sexual arousal to adult women ages 18-30 and, on average, some extent of sexual arousal to adolescent girls ages 12 to 15, and, on average, a little bit of sexual arousal to prepubescent girls ages 5 to 11. They showed the least arousal to prepubescent boys ages 5 to 11 and children under age 5.

The structure of erotic preference in the nondeviant male

48 young men in compulsory military service of similar age (mean age: 20.3) and physical size who lived under similar conditions were used in the study.

""The stimuii consisted of colour slides of nude males and females, representing three age groups (children 4-10 yrs, adolescents 12-16 yrs, adults 17-36 yrs) as determined from age estimates by pediatricians and anthropologists. The forty-two test slides were presented in twenty-one pairs, each containing one of the fifteen different combinations of the six sex and age groups. Each group was represented by seven different photographic subjects. To each S the entire series of slides was exposed twice, with a pause in between.""





Of the 48 young men, with picture types appearing as the first member of the pair, 52% experienced positive reactions to prepubescent girls (age 4 to 10), about about 81.25% experienced positive reactions to the adolescent girls (age 12 to 16), and about 85.42% experienced positive reactions to the adult women (ages 17 to 36). With picture types appearing as the second member of the pair, 58.33% experienced positive reactions to the prepubescent girls, and virtually all 48 (over 93%) experienced positive reactions to the adolescent girls and adult women. With the picture type appearing as the first member of the pair, only 10.42% experienced positive reactions to the prepubescent boys age 4 to 10, 12.5% experienced positive reactions to the adolescent boy age 12 to 16, and around 5% had a positive reaction to adult men age 17 to 36. However, the attraction that over half the men had to prepubescent girls was only slight attraction, whereas they had strong attraction to the adolescent girls and adult women. This is shown below in Figure 2.





""Figure 1 demonstrates that the reaction to pictures of adolescent and adult females was positive, that to males negative, and that to female children intermediate. These results are in keeping with the respective expectations. The figure also demonstrates a greater tendency for a positive acceleration score in response to the second picture of a pair (~2 p<O.Ol), and this holds even for each of the two positive picture types separately (12 p-KO.05).""

Sexual offenders against female children: Sexual preferences for age of victims and type of behaviour

21 incest offenders (fathers molesting their daughters; mean age: 40.1), 40 nonfamilial child molesters (child molesters who molested non-relative girls under age 14; mean age: 34.5) and 22 normal non-criminal men (mean age: 33.9) were used for a study and had their sexual arousals to stimuli measured. The demographics presented in Table 1:





Now here is Figure 1:





Now as you can see here, nonfamilial child molesters often had strong sexual attraction to girls ages 5 to 12 (with the peak at age 9). The attraction decreased but was still high at age 13/14 but then increased at 16 and peaked again at ages 18 to 24. Incest offenders had a lack of attraction to girls under 12 but a little attraction to 12/13 year old girls, moderate attraction to 14 to 18 year old girls, and the most attraction to women ages 20 to 24. The normal, non-criminal men lacked attraction to girls under 14, had minuscule attraction to 14 year old girls, and had fairly high attraction to 16 year old girls and then extremely high attraction to 18 to 24 year old women (with the peak being 18 and 20 year old women). The incest offenders didn't experience much attraction in general in comparison to nonfamilial child molesters and normal controls.

Erectile responses among heterosexual child molesters, father- daughter incest offenders, and matched non-offenders: Five distinct age preference profiles

Howard Barbaree and W.L. Marshall created another study in 1989 where they used the same exact methodology. 21 fathers who molested their daughters (average age of daughter victim: 9.05; SD=3.7), 40 nonfamilial child molesters who molested non-relative girls under age 14 (average age of victim: 8.55; SD=3.0), and 22 normal controls matched in age, intelligence and socioeconomic status were used in the sample.

Results:





The adult profile group (teleiophilia) was the sample of people who were most sexually aroused by adults (categorized as age 16 to 24). They lacked attraction to girls age 3 to 14 and had fairly high attraction to 16 year old girls and very high attraction to 18 to 24 year old women (with the peak being women age 20). The teen-adult profile was rather ephebophilic. They showed hardly any attraction to 3 year old girls and 5 year old girls but a tiny bit of attraction to 7 year old girls. They were somewhat attracted (although not very) to 9 year old girls and had fairly high attraction to 11/12 year olds and very high attraction to 13 to 24 year olds (and found all subgroups in the 13 to 24 age group almot equally attractive). 68% of normal controls were in the adult profile group whereas 14% were in the teen-adult group. 18% of normal controls were non-discriminatory, which means they showed equal (but only fairly but not extremely high) attraction to girls and women of every age (although little attraction to 3 year old girls).







People in the child profile were pedophiles (primarily or exclusively attracted to prepubescent children) and lacked attraction to anyone 13 or older. They had fairly high attraction to 12 year old girls and some degree of attraction to 3 year olds but mostly attraction to girls ages 5 to 11 (with the very peak being age 9). The child-adult profile had strong attraction to girls under age 12, lack of attraction to girls age 12 to 14, and fairly high attraction to 16 year old girls but strong attraction to women ages 18 to 14 (with the peak being ages 18 to 22). These are non-exclusive pedophiles.

Deviant Sexual Behavior: Differentiating Sex Offenders by Criminal and Personal History, Psychometric Measures, and Sexual Response

In a sample of incarcerated rapists (sample size=49; mean age=27.8 and SD=5.7), people who molested pubescent and/or teenage girls (sample size=19; mean age 31.0 and SD=5.2), and people who molest prepubescent girls/boys, they found this chronophilia (sexual attraction to a specific age group) preference profile for the first two aforementioned types of sexual offenders when measuring sexual arousal:





The rapists (who had adult victims or peer-age victims) experienced moderate (but mostly sufficient enough to qualify as an adequate response as defined later in this paragraph) sexual arousal to 15 year old girls but strong attraction to 18 to 25 year old women. They experienced minuscule attraction to 12 year old girls and no attraction to girls under 12. Their attraction started off very low at age 5 and increased with age. According to the data: ""Adequate response was defined as attaining a peak response of at least 20% of full erection to at least one stimulus in any one of the auditory or visual stimulus series presented to that subject.""

Erotic preference in pedophilia

20 university students age 21 to 32 (mean age: 24.5) and 20 recent immigrants age 21 to 38 (mean age: 24.5) served as paid volunteers in a study. 4 age groups with 6 photographs each of nude people (a combination of 48 photos) were shown to the men with the age groups specified below:

Female:

Age group 1:

Age range: 5 years and 7 months to 8 years and 3 months (mean age: 6 years and 6 months)

Age group 2:

Age range: 8 years and 4 months to 11 years and 5 months (mean age: 9 years and 6 months)

Age group 3:

Age range: 12 to 14 (mean age: 12 years and 8 months)

Age group 4:

Age range: 22 years and 9 months to 26 years and 3 months (mean age: 23 years and 2 months)

Male:

Age group 1:

Age range: 5 years and 4 months to 7 years and 7 months (mean age: 6 years and 7 months)

Age group 2:

Age range: 8 years and 8 months to 11 years (mean age: 9 years and 7 months)

Age group 3:

Age range: 12 years to 14 years and 8 months (mean age: 13 years and 6 months)

Age group 4:

Age range: 19 years to 25 years and 8 months (mean age: 22 years and 5 months)

Results (Figure 1):





Men showed less arousal to girls under age 10 (but showed some degree of arousal to 10 year old girls despite a low arousal to 11 year old girls). Although they showed a little attraction (but not very much) to 12 year old girls, they showed higher (but only somewhat high instead of very high) attraction to 13 and 14 year old girls, and they showed very high attraction to adult women in their 20s. They lacked attraction to men and boys of each age group.

As shown in Figure 2 below, men lacked attraction to any body parts men and boys had. They lacked attraction to prepubescent girls' body parts (except for minuscule attraction to prepubescent girls' lower belly pubic region). Men had minuscule attraction to pubescent girls' chest region but moderately high attraction to pubescent girls' lower belly pubic region. When it comes to women in their 20s, they showed some degree of attraction to women's face and legs but very high attraction to the chest region and maximum attraction to the lower belly pubic region.

Erotic preference in pedophilia

27 heterosexual pedophiles, 20 homosexual pedophiles, 23 ephebophiles (homosexuals preferring teenage boys age 13 to 16 or 17), 25 androphiles (homosexuals preferring adult men AKA gay teleiophiles) and 35 normal controls were included in the study. Some of the non-normal controls pretended to prefer adult women. (These pretenders were distributed as follows: 19 heterosexual pedophiles, 9 homosexual pedophiles, and 8 gay ephebophiles.) Slides of male children, female children, male adolescents, female adolescents, male adults and female adults all were shown to the men in the overall sample.

Interestingly, the normal men were somewhat attracted to the female children, but had very strong attraction to both the adolescent girls and adult women. In fact, the difference in attraction to the adolescent girls and the adult women was very small. They only found adult women just slightly more attractive than the adolescent girls, but had strong attraction to both. They had no attraction to men and boys. Additionally, they found that gay teleiophilic men (gay men preferring adult male partners) had strong attraction to both adult men and adolescent boys, with the attraction to adult men being only a little higher. They had only minuscule attraction to male children, even more minuscule attraction to adult women and adolescent girls, and absolutely no attraction at all to female children. The 15 ephebophiles who didn't deny their sexuality had extremely high attraction to adolescent boys, moderately high attraction to adult men, medium attraction to male children, very minuscule attraction to adolescent girls, and no attraction at all to adult women and female children. The gay ephebophiles who pretended to prefer adult women showed high attraction to adolescent boys, some attraction to adult women and adolescent girls, and lack of attraction to adult men and both male and female children.

Facial, Olfactory, and Vocal Cues to Female Reproductive Value

""Facial photographs, body odors and voice recordings were collected from a total sample of 121 heterosexual women from three different age groups: young girls (n = 50; age range = 11-15 years, M = 13.76 years, SD = 1.44 years), adult women (n = 42; age range = 19-30 years, M = 23.48 years, SD = 2.47 years) and circum-menopausal women (n = 29; age range = 50-65 years, M = 56.83 years, SD = 5.17 years). Participants were recruited from the local population of Göttingen (Germany) and all reported to be native German speakers. To control for possible effects of exogenous hormones on attractiveness, only participants who reported not using any kind of hormonal contraceptive or supplements at the time of data collection were recruited. All participants received 30 euros financial compensation.""

""The women were instructed to adopt neutral facial expressions and remove make-up, glasses and any other facial adornments (e.g., facial jewellery). All participants were asked to tie back their head hair with a black hair-band. In post-processing, faces were isolated from remaining other visible features (such as hair and the neck) by colouring these features black in Adobe Photoshop CS3 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, USA). Finally, all digital images were scaled to a resolution of 433 x 600 pixels for presentation in the rating component of the study.""

""Digital facial photographs, body odor samples (via T-shirts) and voice recordings were presented in three independent rating studies to a total sample of 450 male participants (age range = 18-40 years, M = 23.84 years, SD = 3.50 years) and rated on attractiveness and femininity. All participants received 5 euros compensation for their time.""

""A panel of 150 men (age range = 18-40 years, M = 23.68 years, SD = 3.25 years) rated 24 facial photographs that were randomly selected out of the total sample, 12 of them on attractiveness and another 12 on femininity. Attractiveness and femininity were rated in separate blocks of trials and trial order was fully randomized. Another 150 men (age range = 18-40 years, M = 23.20 years, SD = 2.97 years) judged each a subset of 24 voice recordings on attractiveness and femininity using the same procedure. Medialab 2008 software (Empirisoft Inc., New York, USA) was used for face and voice presentation and ratings were made on a 5-point scale (1 = not at all attractive/feminine to 5 = very attractive/feminine). For the assessments of voice recordings participants listened to the samples using circum-aural earphones (Superlux HD681F). All voice recordings were set to constant amplitude, and participants were instructed to judge the voices spontaneously as the samples were played only once before they were prompted to make a decision.""

""A panel of 150 men (age range = 18-40 years, M = 24.65 years, SD = 4.04 years) was recruited to judge the smell of 12 T-Shirts, randomly selected from the total sample, for attractiveness and femininity. The T-shirt rating took place in separate sessions, over a time period of three weeks. At each session, 12 T-Shirts were defrosted three hours before the rating and put into 5 litre glass jars with clamp lids, numbered from 1 to 12 and judged by 10 participants. They were told to pick one jar after the other (the order differing between participants), shake it, open it and smell it without touching the T-Shirt, then rate the smell of the T-Shirt for attractiveness and femininity on a 5-point scale (1 = not at all attractive/feminine to 5 = very attractive/feminine). Participants provided their ratings using paper questionnaires that were placed next to each jar.""

""Analyses showed a significant effect of age group for ratings of both facial attractiveness (F = 25.58, p < .001; n2 = 0.30) and vocal attractiveness (F = 41.34, p < .001; n2 = 0.41), but not for ratings of body odor attractiveness (F = 0.39, p = .68; n2 = .007; Figure 1). For facial attractiveness, young girls received the highest attractiveness ratings (M = 2.12, SD = 0.43), followed by that of adult women (M = 1.91, SD = 0.44), and circum-menopausal women (M = 1.43, SD = 0.34). Both, young girls and adult women were judged to be significantly more attractive than circum-menopausal women (both p < .001), whereas the difference in attractiveness ratings between young girls and adult women was not quite significant (p = .06). For vocal attractiveness, adult women received higher attractiveness ratings than did young girls and circum-menopausal women (adult women: M = 3.16, SD = 0.49; young girls: M = 2.78, SD = 0.58; circum-menopausal women: M = 1.99, SD = 0.50), and attractiveness ratings for each of the three groups differed significantly from one another (all p < .01).

Pairwise comparisons of body odor attractiveness ratings between the age groups did not show any significant difference (all p = .99).

The ANOVAs for femininity ratings also showed a main effect of age group for ratings of women’s faces (F = 8.49, p < .001; 2 = 0.13) and voices (F = 33.12, p < .001; 2 = 0.36), but not for ratings of body odors (F = 0.05, p = .96; 2 = 0.0008; Figure 2). Faces of young girls received higher femininity ratings than those of adult women and circum- menopausal women (young girls: M = 3.16, SD = 0.56; adult women: M = 2.83 SD = 0.57; circum-menopausal women: M = 2.67, SD = 0.47).""

""Pairwise comparisons showed that femininity ratings of young girls’ faces were significantly higher than those of adult (p < .05) and circum-menopausal women’s faces (p < .001), but that adult women and circum-menopausal women did not differ in rated femininity (p = .63). Analyses also showed that vocal femininity ratings of adult women were higher than those of young girls and circum-menopausal women (adult women: M = 3.41, SD = 0.44; young girls: M = 3.29, SD = 0.55; circum-menopausal women: M = 2.41, SD = 0.66). Pairwise comparisons showed that femininity ratings of circum-menopausal women’s voices were significantly lower than those of young girls’ or adult women’s voices (both p < .001), but no significant difference between femininity ratings of young girls’ and adult women’s voices (p = .91). Pairwise comparisons of body odor femininity ratings between the age groups did not show any significant difference (all p > .05).

Female age was positively correlated with vocal attractiveness in the group of young girls (r = .49, p < .001) and negatively correlated with vocal attractiveness in the group of adult women (r = -.39, p < .05). The correlation between age and vocal attractiveness in the group of circum-menopausal women was not significant, however (r = .08, p = .69). Although female age was also positively correlated with facial attractiveness in the group of young girls (r = .31, p < .05), it did not predict facial attractiveness in the groups of adult (r = .04, p = .81) or circum-menopausal (r = -.30, p = .12) women. Female age did not correlate with body odor attractiveness in any of the three groups (all absolute r < .24, all p > .10)."" This is explained further by this quote: ""Moreover, there were differences in regard to men’s attractiveness and femininity perception of women’s faces and voices, particularly for the group of young girls and adult women. Young girls’ faces were judged to be more attractive and feminine than those of adult women while adult women’s voices were judged to be more attractive and feminine than those of young girls. These latter results suggest that men’s perceptions of women’s vocal and facial attractiveness may be more closely tied to femininity than youth, per se (see also, e.g., Feinberg et al., 2008). Indeed, among the group of young girls, age was positively correlated with both facial and vocal attractiveness, suggesting more mature girls may be judged as more attractive."" This means among young girls ages 11 to 15 (M=13.76; SD=1.44), the older girls in the age group (14 and 15 year olds) are seen as both more feminine and more attractive due to increased physical maturity.

Heterosexual Men's Ratings of Sexual Attractiveness of Pubescent Girls: Effects of Labeling the Target Under or Over the Age of Sexual Consent and Heterosexual Men’s Ratings of Sexual Attractiveness of Adolescent Girls: A Cross-Cultural Analysis

""In both studies, participants were UK born, heterosexual, adult men recruited in a university sports center (Study 1) or general locations within a university campus (Study 2). In Study 1, par- ticipants were 53, UK born, heterosexual, adult men (M age = 25.2 years, range 18–42 years). Study 2 participants were 70, UK born, heterosexual, adult men (M age = 31.0 years, range 19–78 years). Data from one participant in Study 2 were dropped because they were not properly attending the task, resulting in their latency data being excessively long and dis- torting group means.""

""All participantscompletedasexualorientationquestionnaire to confirm their heterosexual orientation and computer task. The computer task comprised 61 trials presented on a screen involving a short pseudo-biography (age, home town, star sign, and favorite color), presented for 5 s, followed imme- diately by a photograph of an individual to whom the biography related.

To obtain an explicit measure of attraction, participants in Study 1 were asked to ‘‘rate the sexual attractiveness of the person in each photograph as quickly as you can’’ using a 7-key response pad (from extremely sexually unattractive to extremely sexually attractive). In Study 2, the instructions explicitly asked for the participants’ own judgments of attraction, with the instructions being to rate 'how sexually attractive you find each individual as quickly as you can.' The time taken to respond was used as an implicit measure of decision ease, where shorter latencies (quicker responding) indexed an easier decision and longer latencies indexed a more effortful decision (due to interference/conflict). Trials were presented on a Dell Latitude D600 Laptop with a 14 in. display via E-Prime software (Version 2.0). Response time measurements were obtained through a Cedrus Response Pad (Model RB-730), with data recorded using E-Data Aid software in conjunction with E-Prime.

Age labels applied to the photograph were grouped into four image categories: target underage (14–15 years), target within age (16–17 years), distracter women (19–25 years), and distracter men (16–27years). Photographs for target underage and within age females were counterbalanced: for half the participants in Study 2 (and 27 of 53 in study 1), half of the target photographs were identified as underage, the other half as within age, with labeling reversed for the remaining participants. In this way, participants only saw the target girl pho- tographs once—identified as either 14–15 years old or 16–17 years old. However, when taking all participants together, the same photographs appeared in underage and overage sets (other pseudo-biographical details remained constant in both conditions). In Study 2, there were 12 target underage pictures, 12 target overage pictures, 7 distracter female pictures, and 30 distracter male pictures. Picture sets in Study 1 were essentially the same as this, but with some minor variation. All photographs were obtained from publicly available open sources. All individuals were presented wearing swim-wear or underwear. Adobe Photoshop cs5 was used to edit the photographs, so all depictions were of a similar size and presented mid-screen on a white background. No participant reported being aware of the purpose of the study nor did they question the ages of the young women as presented during the study. All aspects of the research were approved by the relevant Ethics Committee.

For each study, two key analyses were conducted. In the first, comparisons of mean attractiveness ratings and reaction times across the four conditions (target underage, within age, distracter men, distracter women) were made in a series of one-way repeated measures ANOVAs. The second series of analyses examined the correlations between reaction times and attractiveness ratings in each condition.

The researchers conducted the same study again a year later with the same exact photographs/age labels and methodology on a sample of Bulgarian men: ""Participants were 36 Bulgarian-born heterosexual, adult men recruited using a snowball technique, starting with ‘friends of friends’ and expanding out. Their mean age was 34.5 years (SD = 12.88). Recruitment was conducted in Bulgaria.""

""Three sets of photographs were presented: seven photographs of women identified as being 19–25 years old, 30 photographs of men identified as being between 16 and 27 years, and those of adolescent girls. The latter were labelled as either 14–15 years old or 16–17 years old. In total, participants saw 24 photographs of adolescent girls: twelve labelled as being between 14 and 15 years (6 = 14 years, 6 = 15 years), and 12 labelled as being between 16 and 17 years (6 = 16 years, 6 = 17 years). Their presentation was counterbalanced, such that 18 participants saw half the photograph set labelled as 14–15 years and half labelled as 16–17 years; 18 participants saw the same photographs with the opposite label. Accordingly, no participant saw the same photographs with different age labels.""

""The mean and standard deviations for each country’s attractiveness ratings are shown in Fig. 1. ANOVA revealed no differences in mean scores for each category of photographs across the three country samples, F(2, 153)=1.69, p=.19, partial g2 = .02. However, there were significant differences, F(3, 459) = 162.67, p<.001, partial g2 = .52, between attraction ratings in each category of photographs. Pairwise comparisons (Bonferroni corrected) showed that both young and older girls were rated as significantly less attractive than women (p<.001), but more attractive than men (p<.001). In addition, older girls were rated as more attractive than younger girls (p<.001).""

""Key findings were that apparently younger girls were rated as less attractive than (the same) apparently older girls, who in turn were considered less attractive than women. These findings were highly significant and did not differ across countries.""

Other studies:

In a sample of 2,278 male patients (1,066 heterosexual teleiophiles, 761 heterosexual hebephiles, 159 heterosexual pedophiles, 110 homosexual pedophiles, 86 homosexual hebephiles, and 96 homosexual teleiophiles) (many being sex offenders against children, adults or both) with a mean age of 37.48 (SD=13.21) and a median education of high school graduation, they looked at the chronophilias of each men. The teleiophilic ones (attraction primarily to adults) would presumably have the same age preferences as the general population of teleiophilic men (most men are teleiophiles). Hebephilic and pedophilic ones would, for the aforementioned reason, have the same age preference as hebephiles in general and pedophiles in general, respectively. (Remember pedophilia is an attraction paraphilia, not an action). Here's the results:

View attachment 550286

In another study, 214 gynephlilic (attraction to female people) and teleiophilic (attraction to adults) male patients for traits like sex crimes, paraphilic or problematic sexual behavior, etc. with no offense history against girls under 17 or male people and no possible evidence of non-teleiophilia/non-heterosexuality behavior-wise or attraction-wise were used in a study. The average age was 35.74 (SD=11.62). 35.5% of the men had no known sexual offenses and 64.5% had offenses against at least 1 adult woman, rape, frotteurism, exhibitionism, and obscene telephone calling. Audiotaped narratives involving prepubescent girls and boys ages 5 to 9, pubescent boys/girls age 11 to 13, and adult men/women. Photographic models included prepubescent girls ages 3 to 11, pubescent girls age 12 to 14, adult women age 20 to 35, prepubescent boys age 5 to 11, pubescent boys age 12 to 14, and adult men age 19 to 41. Results shown below:

View attachment 550293

One limitation was addressed, but it doesn't appear to make a difference in the results: ""One might query the generalizability of the results obtained from this population, given that approximately 65% had been convicted of one or more sexual offenses and that the remaining 35% accessed services in the Sexual Behaviors Clinic because of some type of sexual concern or problem. Although this undoubtedly is not the typical college sample of males often recruited for psychological or sexuality studies, we do not believe this to be a very serious limitation, as the results of the current study very closely confirmed results obtained from volunteers in previous research.""

Another study showed more detailed results of men's sexuality. 2,355 men (including mostly male patients with the same characteristics in two previous studies) were included in a study and grouped together by chronophilia (sexual attraction to a specific age group). Their average age was 37.75 (SD=13.24 years) and their median education level was Grade 12. They were asked to rate each age group by attractiveness and asked about their erotic age/gender preferences for the following age groups:

Phallometry was used to measure arousal to audionarrative (including of prepubescent children ages 5 to 9, pubescent minors ages 11 to 13, and adult men/women) and nude photographic models of age groups: ""The original set of photographic models on which the present test was based comprised prepubescent girls age 5–11, pubescent girls 12–14, adult women 22–26, prepubescent boys 5–11, pubescent boys 12–14, and adult men 19– 25 (Freund, Langevin, Cibiri, & Zajac, 1973; Freund, Mc- Knight, Langevin, & Cibiri, 1972). There have been some additions or substitutions of models in the intervening years, primarily involving the adults. The new models extended the ages of the prepubescent girls to 3–11 years, the ages of the adult women to 20–35 years, and the ages of the adult men to 19–41 years.""

They also measured sexual arousal to age/gender groups through phallometry but did NOT include mid-late teenagers, which prevents ephebophiles from experiencing maximum arousal to any age group.

Heterosexual Aversion in Homosexual Males [link]

36 gay men ages 21 to 43 (mean age=26.9) who preferred adult partners ages 20 to 30 from 3 gay nightclubs were paid volunteers in a study alongside 18 heterosexual university students and 18 heterosexual recent immigrants ages 21 to 39 (mean age=24.7). Their sexual arousal through phallometry was measured to the following stimuli:

View attachment 550376

The penile response data is shown below. The gay men showed minuscule attraction to boys under age 12, moderately high attraction to pubescent boys age 12 to 14, and very high attraction to young adult men. The straight men showed minuscule attraction to girls ages 5 to 8, a little attraction to girls age 8 to 11, moderately high attraction to pubescent girls age 12 to 14, and very high attraction to young adult women.

IDENTIFYING SEXUAL PREFERENCES IN INTRAFAMILIAL AND EXTRAFAMILIAL CHILD SEXUAL ABUSERS

62 heterosexual intrafamilial sex offenders (father-daughter incest offenders with daughter victims under 17), 57 heterosexual extrafamilial child molesters with victims under 17), 25 homosexual extrafamilial child molesters with victims under 17, and 47 controls (normal, heterosexual, nondeviant men from the community) all were used for a study. Their age did not differ much (average age: 33.99; SD=8.75). ""The heterosexual extrafamilial and incest offenders had significantly less education (means 10.23 and 9.96 years, respectively) than the controls and homosexual extrafamilial offenders (means 12.74 and 12.60, respectively). There were no other statistically significant group differences in education.""

""A series of twenty-seven 16 mm movie clips were utilized as erotic stimuli in this study. These pictures consisted of 4 age-sex categories of men, women, boys and girls. The age categories were 6 to 8, 9 to 11, 13 to 15 and 18 to 25 years of age for both genders. There were three repeats of each age-sex category and three sexually neutral clips. The clips were sequenced in a pseudo random order within each of 3 stimulus blocks, after Freund, et al. (1972). Movie clips were used because penile reactions to movies tend to be larger than those to slides.""

Results shown below. The normal men showed very high attraction to 18 to 25 year old women, some degree of attraction to 13 to 15 year old girls, minuscule attraction to 9 to 11 year old girls and no attraction at all to 6 to 8 year old girls, neutral stimuli and men/boys of all ages.





An Internet Study of Men Sexually Attracted to Children: Sexual Attraction Patterns

1,189 men (mean age: 33.66 to 33.7; SD=13.2) recruited from forums for men attracted to children were included in a study, many being forums that condemn child molesting and encourage these men to avoid acting on their attraction. Some men instead came from smaller referral sources and some men didn't clarify how they discovered the study. This sample includes 125 female-attracted non-exclusive ephebophiles (non-exclusive means they can fall into more than one chronophilia and have more than 1 highest rated age group, which results in ties), 18 female-attracted exclusive (exclusive means there's an age group they have way more attraction to than any other age group, having only 1 highest-rated age group) ephebophiles, 95 male-attracted non-exclusive ephebophiles, 15 male-attracted exclusive ephebophiles, 162 female-attracted non-exclusive teleiophiles, 37 female-attracted exclusive teleiophiles, 64 male-attracted non-exclusive teleiophiles, and 15 male-attracted exclusive teleiophiles.

Results are shown below, and it is similar to results shown in other studies examining men's sexual arousal or rating patterns regardless of the sampling methodology, so a sampling bias wouldn't be a severe limitation. The age groups are prepubescent (age 10 and below), pubescent (age 11 to 14), adolescent (15 to 16), and adult (17 and older).





The Puzzle of Male Chronophilias





In his article The Puzzle of Male Chronophilias, pedophilia expert and sexologist Michael C. Seto wrote: ""a sexual interest in sexually mature adolescents, though socially sanctioned in modern Western societies if under the legal age of consent, is neither uncommon nor atypical."" He elaborated:

""Ephebophilia is subject to a great deal of confusion because of its conflation with legal standards and moral norms. For example, the fact that the age of consent is 16 in Canada and in many American states, and that there is clearly some interest in regarding this age range—as demonstrated by ‘‘barely legal’’ or ‘‘schoolgirl’’ pornography genres, popular cultural memes regarding ‘‘jailbait,’’ the use of young teen models in mainstream fashion and other media—does not directly speak to the existence of ephebophilia. Because of the blurriness of sexual maturation from adolescence into adulthood, teleiophilic men and women might well have some sexual attraction to 15–17 year olds, even if it is illegal and/or socially frowned upon. Moreover, some young adults look like minors (and some minors look like adults).""

Seto and fellow researcher Skye Stephens wrote together: ""Conceptually, hebephilia is a paraphilia, reflecting an atypical (statistically rare) sexual age interest in pubescent children. In contrast, a sexual preference in older adolescents (ephebophilia) would probably not meet Wakefield's definition, given older adolescents are reproductively viable and the fact that typically men are sexually attracted to older adolescents, as reflected in self-report, psychophysiological, and pornography use studies."" They then wrote about early pubescent minors (ages 11 to 14): ""Given that teleiophilic men still show sexual response to non-preferred age categories, showing some response to pubescent children is normative. Showing more arousal to pubescent children than to adults, or not discriminating between these two categories, is not normative.""

CONSENSUS AMONG RESEARCHERS

Although studies vary on whether it's normative to find pubescent girls age 11 to 14 attractive (some studies show it's common to find them at least somewhat attractive whereas some show the opposite), studies consistently show that it's common for ordinary men to find older teens (ages 15 to 17) attractive. Nonetheless, men appear to find 18 to 24 year olds the most attractive, with the peak being age 20. Experts unanimously agree that finding high school-age girls attractive is normal. Sexologist and pedophilia expert James Cantor said: ""It's very common for regular men to be attracted to 18-year-olds or 20-year-olds. It's not unusual for a typical 16-year-old to be attractive to many men, and the younger we go, the fewer and fewer men are attracted to that age group."" Sexologist and pedophilia expert Fred Berlin said: ""Most men can find adolescents attractive sexually, although, of course, that doesn't mean they're going to act on it. Some men who become involved with teenagers may not have a particular disorder. Opportunity and other factors may have contributed to their behaving in the way they do."" Seto elaborated on men's chronophilic preferences: ""Hebephilia,"" he explains, ""is clinically and scientifically defined as a sexual attraction to pubescent children, i.e., kids who are showing some signs of pubertal development but who are still clearly physically immature."" Hebephilia does not include older teenagers. He explains most men are not hebephiles, and most are not attracted to pubescent teens (he most likely is referring to early teens such as 13 year olds). When it comes to the older teens (15 to 17 year olds), Seto said: ""Many men are sexually attracted to older teens,"" he says, ""but not as much as they are sexually attracted to young adults."" Seto cited studies showing that, on average, both straight and gay men show more sexual responses to photos of adults than to photos of older teens (presumably 15 to 17 year olds). Sociologist Sarah Goode, author of Understanding and Addressing Adult Sexual Attraction to Children says that while it's ""pretty normal"" for men to be attracted to teenagers, it's by no means universal. Although I don't know if she's biased or if she has evidence for this, given she is a sociologist instead of a sexologist conducting research through phallometry, but that wouldn't mean she's wrong of course. That would be the credentials fallacy or the identity fallacy, but who knows if she's just saying that due to bias. I couldn't locate where exactly she said that in her book (if that's a quote from her book at all, which, for now, I'm not completely certain about).

Men probably find young adult women the most attractive

Donald Symons, in his book The Evolution of Human Sexuality, ""speculated on the age at which females should be most attractive to males, predicting 23-28 ± 2, '... if males have been designed by selection to 'evaluate' females primarily as sex partners,' and 17-22 ± 2 if '... designed by selection to 'evaluate' females primarily as wives.'"" (p. 189)

Studies have shown consistently that heterosexual men are attracted to youth, and that even a lot of studies show that gay men are attracted to youth.

The age group men find the most attractive appears to be ages 18 to 24, with the very peak being 20 years old. There are 7 chronophilias: nepiophilia (predominant or exclusive sexual attraction to infants or toddlers), pedophilia (a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children generally ages 3 to 10), hebephilia (a predominant/exclusive attraction to early pubescent minors ages 11 to 14), ephebophilia (a predominant sexual attraction to teenagers), teleiophilia (a primary attraction to younger adults ages 18 to 39), mesophilia (attraction primarily to middle aged adults), and gerontophilia (predominant sexual attraction to elders). The prevalence of men who are pedophiles is estimated to be 1 to 5 percent of men (consensus being 1 percent), with hebephilia's prevalence being possibly 2 to 3 times more common (most likely only slightly higher than pedophilia). Hebephilia is only a PREDOMINANT attraction to minors ages 11 to 14 but not the mere attraction to them. Most men are teleiophiles, but although teleiophilic men often can find teenage girls attractive and ephebophilic men often are attracted to women in their 20s, the big difference between teleiophilia and ephebophilia is shown in some charts above. Ephebophiles find women most attractive at 15/16 years old whereas for teleiophilic men, it's around ages 18 to 24 (especially age 20).

An OkCupid study found that men, no matter how old they are, find 20 year olds the most physically and sexually attractive. Even a middle aged man will find early 20s the most attractive. Women in their early-mid 20s find men a bit older the most physically attractive, women in their late 20s and women in their 30s found men around their own age the most physically attractive, and women over 40 found men a few years younger the most physically attractive, with 50 year old women finding men most physically attractive at age 46. According to Christian Rudder of OkCupid: ""This isn’t survey data. This is data built from tens of millions of preferences expressed in the act of finding a date.""





Also, the youngest women get the most attention on dating websites. According to OkCupid blog ""The Case For An Older Woman"", the largest amount of people from the dating pool is interested in a woman when she's about 21 or 22, starting off high at 18. It plummets in the late 20s to where it was at 18 and doesn't plummet to a low number of people interested in her until age 31. It could be it skyrockets to a peak at 21 from 18 because the drinking age is 21 and stigma against age gaps scares men into avoiding 18 to 20 year olds, given that before the late 20th century, age gaps were more common alongside more accepted. 18 year old men have a low number of the dating pool interested in him, skyrocketing to a peak in his mid-late 20s, plummeting after 30 and reaching a low number of the dating pool interested him at 36. However, when men do things even more controversial in terms of social norms, such as pursuing or admitting to attraction to 18 to 20 year olds or even younger, then that's where they're presumably more likely to be honest or show their true colors. No matter what he states his age preference as, the median 30 year old man spends just as much time messaging 18 and 19 year old women as he messages women his own age. On the other hand, women only a few years older are largely neglected. Additionally, 18 year old women receive the most new contacts on OkCupid monthly, with the number of contacts decreasing as she gets older. This is true whether she shows cleavage or not (although the decrease is less intense when cleavage is used by each age group and cleavage helps more contacts appear).







A study also looked at online dating and found that women's desirability peaks at 18, and then falls from there. Men's desirability starts off moderately high at 18 and gradually reaches its peak at age 50, then gradually decreasing after that:

""Once we have our desirability scores, we can use them to identify characteristics of desirable users by comparing scores against various user attributes. As shown in Fig. 2, for instance, average desirability varies with age for both men and women, although it varies more strongly for women, and the effects run in opposite directions: Older women are less desirable, while older men are more so. For women, this pattern holds over the full range of ages on the site: The average woman’s desirability drops from the time she is 18 until she is 60. For men, desirability peaks around 50 and then declines.""





A lot of people might argue that men aren't into youth because they like MILF. First off, I don't think MILF was always a popular porn category (at least not to my knowledge). Additionally, the real reason men like MILF isn't because they find older women just as attractive. They are attracted to how she is dominant and initiates and leads. Many men, believe it or not, enjoy being submissive (I don't mean pegging though). Many like dominant women and MILFs in porn often are dominant and have high status jobs and initiate everything in the video. There are way more men who like being submissive than women who like being dominant (as far as I know). Also, not that many men think cougars are hot (a good amount but not much). Allure surveyed 2,000 Americans. Only 36% of 18 to 29 year old men think cougars are hot, which means 64%, a majority, don't, and the ones who do probably still find young women hotter. Admittedly men in this survey said they think female beauty peaks at age 29 and that women are most seductive at 30, but men in this survey might be saying what is in line with social norms where older men finding very young women most attractive is seen as taboo or creepy. This is a social desirability bias. In studies where men admit to finding the youngest adult women the most attractive or even younger, they are probably more honest given they are saying something that takes a lot of guts to say even anonymously. Besides, only a third of male baby boomers (this was 2013 so they were all 49 to 67 years old at the time) said they find women their own age attractive (which isn't nearly as controversial to say if you say you find 29 year olds the most attractive instead of saying 20 year olds). Cubs (young men who date cougars) typically like cougars for reasons having nothing to do with mesophilia (attraction to middle aged adults). 250 of them were polled (half being 18 to 25 years old) and ""fifty percent of the men say they like older women because there is something sexy about a mature woman who knows her own mind and body. Another 22 percent say younger women aren't mature enough and are full of drama. Nine percent say they think their younger bodies are more likely to turn on an older woman."" Not many only date older women exclusively: ""Only 17 percent say they date older women exclusively. 32 percent say they usually date younger women, but occasionally like to be with an older woman."" Also, although MILF is a popular porn category, teen porn has also had popularity. Teen porn has declined in popularity, possibly due to backlash from society and feminists. Teen was more popular than MILF and one of the top searches in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. Its popularity decreased a little and went behind MILF in 2016. In the late 2010s/early 2020s, teen porn declined in popularity, but many young pornstars in their 20s who look 18 are still popular, such as Lana Rhoades, and Shaiden Rogue is a 20 year old pornstar with lots of views on PornHub, and she got started at 18, with videos of her 18 year old self having lots of popularity.

Conclusion​
Is it normal to find teenage girls attractive? Yes. A lot of men will find a 15 to 17 year old attractive but they find 18 to 24 year olds the most attractive (with the very peak being around age 20). Finding 14 year olds girls attractive is fairly normative and some men can find them somewhat attractive. Some men might find 12 or 13 year old girls somewhat attractive (but some won't have any attraction) and while some men might have a minuscule attraction to prepubescent girls, many men won't find prepubescent girls attractive at all. Finding prepubescent girls and middle school age girls very attractive, however, is unusual, especially for prepubescent girls. Strong attraction to 15 or 16 year olds, however, is pretty normal. Although men find 17 to 24 year olds more attractive, they presumably could find some 15 or 16 year olds just as attractive as women in their early 20s, given that some 15 or 16 year old girls look like they're in their early 20s and women in their early-mid 20s look like they could still be in high school (especially women in their early 20s). So obviously agecucks like IT are idiots when they call this pedophilia (a primary attraction to prepubescent children). Nonetheless, pedocels on this forum who drool all over 9 year olds are abnormal. Pedophilia and hebephilia don't mean a mere attraction to prepubescent and early pubescent minors, but a predominant/exclusive attraction, which is atypical. Ephebophilia isn't classified as a disorder by researchers because attraction to older teens is common and normative among many men. The difference between ephebophilia and teleiophilia is that ephebophiles find 15-16 year olds the most attractive but also have strong attraction to 12 to 14 year olds and 17 to 24 year olds. Teleiophiles have non-existent to medium attraction to 12 to 14 year olds, strong attraction to 15/16 year olds and maximum attraction to 17 to 24 year olds, the age group they find the most attractive (with the peak being around age 20). Men who find teenagers attractive often lack attraction to prepubescent children and real pedophiles lack attraction to teens. As straight men get older, they still find young women most attractive. This also is often true for gay men, and many gay men can find teenage guys attractive, too. Our biology doesn't respond to laws or morals or social norms. Chronophilia is innate and biological. We are attracted to physical development, not age, and if you think women are most attractive at age 20, you probably could find a lot of 17 year olds attractive given girls in those two ages don't look even remotely different. Besides, if you saw someone you thought was in their 20s and thought they're hot and then realized they're 17, you won't lose your attraction to them (repressing it doesn't reduce it). It's not a button to turn on or off just like how getting married doesn't mean you lose your attraction to other women (even if we outlawed adultery unless it's already illegal). If we acknowledge married men can't get rid of their attraction to other women, how is this different when it comes to teenagers? That's the special pleading fallacy. Some girls at 15 to 17 look like they're in their early 20s and some women in their early-mid 20s look like they're in high school.

In short, yes, it is common to find 18 or 20 year olds attractive. It's not unusual for many men to find a 16 year old girl attractive. Some men could find 12 to 14 year olds somewhat attractive whereas some won't, and the younger we go, the fewer and fewer men are attracted to that age group.

Only feminists support paying taxes,Untagged,Robtical,"Mar 26, 2022",18000,150,"Men pay all the taxes and foids get all the benefit. This is what a rostie wrote about stealing tax money from men:

A study from New Zealand shows fairly definitively that we (women), as a group, don’t pay any taxes.

Sure, we file tax documents and have taxes deducted from our paychecks and pay out consumer taxes at the cash register, just like men do, but in the final tally, uh…well, look at this:



GROSS TAX PAID + BENEFITS CLAIMED = NET TAXES PAID

Let me explain. If you pay out, say, $100 every paycheck to the IRS, but every month, you claim $200 in benefits, you have not paid a single penny in tax. In fact, you have claimed twice what you have paid. You are $100 up, and the rest of the taxpayers are footing your bill.

It’s curious that the data New Zealand doesn’t seem to mind sharing is very difficult to acquire in the US. How much money in taxes do men pay versus women? How much money is claimed every month in benefits by men versus women? What is the net difference? We begin with ….. cue ominous music …. THE WAGE GAP!

The US tax system is progressive, meaning the more money you make, the more tax you pay. If men make more money than women, they must pay more tax by definition. There can be no argument that men pay more in gross tax than women. If you tally up at the end of the year all the pennies men gave to the government and compare that to all the pennies women gave, men paid more on that measure alone.

But that is an incomplete measure. We need to know how much money men are withdrawing from the government coffers, compared to women, but let’s not include salaries, since a salary is in theory a trade-off for vital services performed. Let’s only consider payouts within the social safety net.

What are the main government expenditures that don’t include salary?






Of course, women live longer than men and thus draw more social security benefits.

Healthcare? We know that men don’t access healthcare at the same rates as women because masculinity is toxic and men prefer to benefit themselves systematically by directing healthcare dollars to women, and thus we can reasonably presume that women are withdrawing more in healthcare dollars than men.

If we were going to consider salaries paid as a withdrawal from government resources, men would win in the military category of spending, but this would be balanced out by healthcare, social services administration and education, all of which are dominated by women. In terms of withdrawing resources from the military in the form of non-salary benefits, neither women nor men have the advantage. Domestic military benefits are probably restricted to natural disasters and feminists haven’t yet figured out how to make earthquakes kill only men, although I would not be surprised to discover they are trying.

There are considerably more men who have placed themselves in harm’s way in service of the nation, so men likely win the Veteran’s Affairs category hands down, and men are the primary producers of food and drivers of agriculture, so it’s probably safe to assume most of the subsidies and supports in agriculture and food are going to men. But then we have education, and the much vaunted statistic that there are more women than men earning college degrees (In Feminist Dance Therapy, not Particle Physics, but that’s another story), so once again, women are consuming the majority of education dollars.

Men take the majority of government money in the form of agriculture subsidies and veteran’s benefits. In every other major spending category, women are the primary beneficiaries. Women pay less in tax than men pay, while withdrawing significantly more in benefits.

Ergo …

We really don’t pay any tax. We contribute to a system, and then withdraw far more, all of it meaning of course that men – all men – support women – all women – whether they like it or not. When libertarian leaning pundits quip that ‘taxation is theft’, they are missing a piece of the puzzle. Taxation might be theft, but more accurately, it’s theft for our benefit. The government steals money from men and gives it to women."

0.17% Of the Population is Homeless, when accounting for gender differences the amount of Homeless females drops to an astonishing 0.3%








But what percentage of Them are Unsheltered?
















In the Worst Case Scenario ONLY 1.26% OF FEMALES GO UNSHELTERED, and in the Best States for Women That percentage is 0.54%

AS A WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES, YOU HAVE A O.54 --> 1.26% CHANCE OF GOING HOMELESS. 

IT IS WORTH MENTIONING THAT THIS STATISTIC IS TAKEN FROM INDIVIDUAL HOMELESS PEOPLES, AND DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE OTHER HOUSING FROM FRIENDS OR RELATIVES, SO THE AMOUNT OF UNSHELTERED WOMEN COULD BE EVEN LOWER. 



Men are 10 TIMES more likely to die in the workplace. 
~~~
Looking at 139 separate occupations and discrete industries, an obvious pattern quickly emerges: the safest workplaces are indoors and the safest occupations frequently require education beyond high school. The most deadly occupations, on the other hand, are outside and often involve operating equipment. This largely drives the huge difference in workplace fatalities between men and women, with 4,761 men dying on the job compared to 386 women in 2017. The fatality rate for men was about 10 times that of women: 5.7 per 100,000 vs. 0.6 per 100,000 for women.

Meaning that as a women, you have a 0.00050226409% Chance of Dying at Work


From an experiment in the Justice System and Law Enforcement:

More than 500 judges from a state court system (68 percent men, 30 percent women, and 2 percent unidentified) participated in the study in an effort by that court system to address gender bias. The court system wasn't identified for confidentiality reasons.
More than 500 lay people (59 percent men, 41 percent women) also were recruited online to take part in the study.

The judges and lay people analyzed two mock court cases, including a child custody case and a sex discrimination lawsuit where the plaintiff was presented as either a man or woman. The participants also completed surveys about their beliefs in traditional gender roles, such as stereotypes that women are more interested in raising children than in their careers and that children are better off if their fathers are the primary breadwinners for the family.

In the divorce case, the father and mother both sought primary custody of their two children. Both spouses worked full-time jobs and sometimes had conflicts with caring for their children. Judges and lay people who supported traditional gender roles allocated more custody time to the mother than to the equally-qualified father, but the judges were even more biased in favoring the mother than were laypeople. Only three percent of the judges in the sample gave the father more custody time than the mother.

In the exact same scenario as a man, a women has only a 3% chance of losing custody. 

But what about in cases that do not involve child custody?

Scholars have found that women receive shorter sentences for sex crimes than men. A 2014 study suggests that federal courts are more lenient on femaledefendants in general. ... Women were less likely to be detained before trial. They were 46 percent less likely than men to held in jail prior to a trial.

From the 2014 Study:

In general, it was found that females were treated more leniently by the court system, although specific groups of female defendants were found to experience cumulative disadvantage across the criminal court system.

The majority of Relationships are ended by Women, with them accounting for 76% of breakups:

YouGov, an online market research and data analytics firm, surveyed around 1000 adults who have been or still are in a long-term relationship. The participants were asked questions related to their love life including, how many long-term relationships they have been in so far? To how many partners they have said ‘I love you’? Did they ever have 
a break-up in their long-term relationship? If yes, then who ended it?

Going by the statistics, a whopping 76 per cent of the female participants admitted ending their long-term relationship
Digging deeper into this topic, 84 per cent men revealed that they were dumped in their previous relationship

--Someone isn't being honest here... virtue signalling gender?

https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=1844 -- There's even a whole book on how women have leveraged the power of their vaginas to get high ranking political positions in Britany and used it to harm disenfranchised men.


Conclusion: As a female you have an increased chance of being promoted in the workforce despite showing lesser performance, holding power in and ending relationships. You have a lower chance of being homeless, being homeless and unsheltered and an advantage in the legal system. You have the power to abort a baby.

What do the statistics say?
""Female privilege is very real, and very big, as a women, it's damn near impossible to lose""

The ancient Greeks considered physical and moral beauty to be identical (kalon),Blackpill,Atavistic Autist,"Aug 30, 2019",17000,76,"Lookism is so ingrained in human beings that they've always associated good looks with good morals (and conversely, bad looks with bad morals).

This ultimately translates into an association between power and morality, where the aristocratic higher class is defined as noble (literally noblemen), and the common people are seen as vulgar (with all its connotations of ugliness).

In the era of Drumpf (notice: a purposefully ugly rendition of Trump's name), you see this manifested in the privileged and preening liberal elite denouncing the middle American masses, who they imagine as ugly, fat rednecks on mobility scooters. And, on the other hand, you see this manifested in the believers of racial aristocracy, who contrast the beauty and moral worth of their own race with the ugliness and moral decrepitude of others (and crucially, they hold the idea of being besieged and outnumbered by these inferior others).

I think it is incumbent upon us as the vanguard intelligentsia of the Blackpill to propose an alternative view of morality as it relates to physicality and power: that what makes a man moral, virtuous, and just is his experience of exclusion from this rotten and immoral society, which provides a level of insulation against it. Incels are the perfect examples of this, because we are not only aberrational outcasts from society but totally unrepresented by any mainstream grievance politics too; since we have no power base to rely on, we are therefore the purest people on earth, not corrupted by power, but vicars of the people, true representatives of humanity.

It is estimated that as much as 15% of medieval societies were composed of the ruling class, which is a rough reflection of the 80/20 rule."
Marxism-Rodgerism. Opinions?,Untagged,mlcurrycel,"Aug 28, 2018",11000,128,"It may seem difficult to understand the realities of the blackpill. It may be hard to come to terms with how - and why - the world functions as it does. And even when you do, it is even harder to understand where to go next.

But there is one set of techniques which shines a clear light on the world we live in. A scientific and logical analysis of systems of limited resources - Marxism. When we undertake a Marxist analysis of the sexual economy, we immediately find its nuances explained and its realities presented for all to see.

The fundamental element of inequality is exploitation. In economic Marxism, exploitation occurs when a capitalist takes most of the value a worker's labor creates, leaving them barely enough to survive. In other words, the worker's surplus value is stolen from them. This is how capitalists make profits. Sometimes, the capitalists let some segments of workers keep more of their value, in order to bribe and pacify them.

In the sexual economy, there are two distinct classes of men - Chads...and everyone else. There is a group which keeps most women for itself - the Chad-Bourgeois - and a much larger group which, despite being responsible for maintaining global civilization with their labor so that Chad is free to take all he wants, is denied most women. These are the sexual proletariat.

The sexuality of women should be evenly spread among society, but it is not. Instead, it is commodified by sexual capitalism and given to Chad. The Chad-Bourgeoisie allow the sexual proletariat to have just as much pussy as they need to keep the human race alive through reproduction. But even here is it not fair; the proletariat get Chad's leftovers - only when the Chad-Bourgeois no longer want a woman does she go to settle down, marry, and reproduce with a non-Chad.

Now, I mentioned before that the economic bourgeois sometimes bribe workers by giving them more than they would otherwise. In the modern era, the Chad-Bourgeois are facing a world where the proletariat is no longer consigned to the feudal life of arranged marriages without any questions asked, and can see the reality of sexual inequality via media and their own insights. The Chad-Bourgeois responds by bribing the sexual proletariat - they, too, are now allowed to have sex before marriage, and perhaps fuck many women. These women are, of course, still the ones Chad doesn't want, but it bribes most of the world. Remember, this happened when the sexual free market, where women can now choose their partners without having to marry a non-Chad in the end, replaced the Feudal system of arranged marriage. This is sexual capitalism.

The people so bribed are normies. This is the main reason why normies are blind to the sexual capitalist system and lack revolutionary potential.

But the system is imperfect. Due to the female's nature, not all members of the proletariat can be bribed just by the Chad-Bourgeois allowing (pseudo) free sex for everyone. A group at the bottom is inevitability left out - incels.

As sexual feudalism shifted to sexual capitalism, a contradiction was exposed - the Contradiction of Sexual Capitalism is the existence of incels, and the conclusion of the capitalist stage of history must be the resolving of this contradiction. Due to how females are hardwired to be only attracted to Chads, incels always lose in a sexual free market. Many females would rather be single than marry an incel, and a result the incels become a class which doesn't even get marriage, much less any additional bribes. Due to their extreme condition, the incels become ""blackpilled"" and see the system as it is. The incels thus attain class consciousness.

The basic structure of the sexual world is that the Chad-Bourgeois take all the pussy they can, especially the desirable kind, while eventually passing their leftovers to the sexual proletariat as bribes and allowances. Among the latter group, those are who successfully bribed are normies, and those who become class conscious are incels.

So how do the Chad-Bourgeois manage to keep society under their control, even with incels attain class consciousness? In Marxism, the answer is the Base and superstructure. In a sexual capitalist society, all we know is shaped by the system of sexual economy we live in. Our culture, beliefs, and so on are bent to conform to and reinforce the Chad-Bourgeois narrative. In order to prevent the sexual proletariat from attaining class consciousness, the Chad-Bourgouse use culture to create a false consciousness for them to live in instead.

The key to understanding this is to understand that truth is relative to one's class. Comrade Lenin explained this with his concept of partiinost, party truth. What is ""true"" depends on your class, truth for one class may be falsehood for another. Thus, what class's ""truth"" you're listening to is very important.

For example, let's take the Chad-Bourgeois idea of ""confidence."" Confidence is an intentionally vague idea to explain Chad's sexual success as anything besides winning the genetic lottery. It is said that someone - anyone - with ""confidence"" can also live like Chad does. For the Chad-Bourgoise, this is true. All a Chad has to do is be willing step outside or set up an online dating profile and they will get all the pussy they want. However, for the rest of the world, this is not the case. By enforcing the idea of confidence instead of genetic luck, Chad yet again bribes the sexual proletariat - bribes them with hope. The idea of confidence explains structural inequality as personal failure - in the same way the capitalist tells the exploited worker that he, too, would be rich if he only worked harder, so does the Chad tell the sexual proletariat that they could have sex if they were only just a little more confident. In this way, the sexual proletariat are blamed for their own oppression - their celibacy is a result of their own moral failings, because they were not ""confident"" enough. The Chad-Bourgeois present themselves as having earned the pussy they inherent, while the rest of the world deserves to live without. Confidence is just one example of how sexual capitalism distorts culture and creates false narratives to keep people blind.

Normies love false narratives because they are bribed. A normie, who may have even had sex, believes that his success in the past means the confidence narrative and so on is true - he can truly be a Chad, if he works hard enough! Thus the normies convince themselves Chad's world is not only fair but desirable, because they too might have a chance of being chad.

Normies are deceived to varying degrees.

A regular normie has had their bribe a few times and doesn't bother to think about the realities of exploitation and the sexual economy. These normies can be blackpilled with evidence, but most of them just double down on the false consciousness due to their hope that they can be a Chad.

A beta is a normie who is faced with the reality of sexual inequality. He may be an orbiter, hanging around women in the hope he'll get sex. He may be a nice guy, who is nice to women for the same reason. He may be cucked, whereby he shares a single woman with other men so that he can at least get laid. Though he may deny it, he is painfully aware of these material and sexual realities.

A white knight has come against a blackpill before, and it scared them. They swing the other way - they actively try and spread Chad's narrative and enforce it, because they are trying convince themselves. There is great overlap between white knights and Betas, as the latter often exhibit white knight behavior. Many Betas turn into white knights when confronted with the black pill.

All normies have one thing in common - they do not want to accept the reality of the blackpill because they want to continue to believe they can be Chad. Another element is that they enjoy Chad's narrative when it suits them - regarding incels. They don't like to remember that Chad is sexually more successful then them because he is just better....but that's not so bad if it means that they are better than incels in turn, since they at least ""earned"" some sex and incels could not! In economic capitalism, the reality of economic status defined by class is ignored in favor of an individualist, democratic narrative, and sexual capitalism works the same way. The realities of incels and the Chad-Bourgeois are overlooked in favor of the lie that it's all about individual action, that any individual can work his way to the top of the sexual marketplace through hard work and imaginary concepts like ""confidence.""

By the methods described above, the Chad-Bourgeois extract all of the surplus value - in this context, surplus pussy - from the workers/sexual proletariat for themselves, and maintain the system through bribing normies and creating false consciousness. But here's where it gets really interesting - the immortal science of historical materialism explains even more than this.

Everyone knows that even among Chads there is a hierarchy - a racial hierarchy, with white Chad at the top. In the 1960s, Comrade Mao Zedong developed Marxist-Leninist-Maoism to explain the differences between the first world and the third world. Maoism reveals the first world exploits the third world through imperialism, and sets up a global class hierarchy of sorts. This economic hierarchy in turn ties into a sexual hierarchy - one where the imperialist white Chads are above the colonized Chads. A critique of imperialism explains the racial Chad hierarchy - which, of course, filters down into the sexual proletariat as well.

Following this trend, we can see the close interconnection between looks (Chad privilege) and economic success. Females like money and power...and it seems Chad ends up with those as well.

We all know that studies have proven Chads are much more likely to succeed in economic sphere. They are given quality jobs and often end up in very social, very prestigious positions like executive officers. But this shows us that wealth comes second. Poor Chads still dominate the sexual proletariat, and their poverty, on average, never lasts long. In other words, sexual inequality comes before economic inequality, and due to how intertwined they are, it means that economic inequality is a consequence of sexual inequality due to society's constant preference for Chad. Sexual inequality predates economic capitalism, feudalism, even primitive tribalism - sexual inequality is the original and eternal form of hierarchy, it is harbinger of all other inequalities in other areas.

Thus, the Revolutionary and Immortal Science of Marxist-Rodgerism is born. We see that the fundamental conflict is between the well endowed Chad-Bourgeoisie and the sexual proletariat, and that all other conflicts ultimately derive from this great inequality. We see that the Chad-Bourgeois manipulates culture and society to further its narratives and worldview to maintain this power structure. Finally, we must conclude that the only way forward for humanity is to dismantle the system of sexual capitalism so that sex can be distributed fairly to all members of society.

Incels of the world, rise up! You have nothing to lose but your chains!

If the 80/20 rule is true within the 80% of men which it probably is, a man in the bottom 64% has a 1/16 chance of having a gf. Consequently, the men in the bottom 51.2 % must share 0.2^3 of the women and have only 1 1/64 chance of having a girlfriend. If the 80/20 rule is true is true for the top 20% of men, the top 4% of men can have 16 gf:s each on average. The average man has such a low chance of having a woman pursuing him while the top men, the Chads according to this mathemathical model have so many women pursuing them. The top 20% of men alone have 4 women pursuing each of them on average. If you are in the bottom 20% of men, only 0.00000046256% of women are pursuing you according to this formula.
The graph I'm posting reveal that the sum of women who must be shared is negligible for the bottom 3/4 of men. Women are also a zero-sum game where improving yourself and getting one woman does not increase the number of women got, just the effort put into getting them."
"High school never ends, exists throughout life: bullies/popularity/peer pressure/gossip/rumors/cliques exist throughout life (it doesn't get better)",Blackpill,Edmund_Kemper,"Feb 8, 2022",19000,103,"Youngcels in particular should read this: all of the things you were told ends after high school, exists throughout life, from preschool to later adulthood. Bullying, peer pressure, rumors, gossip, popular people, cliques, drama, etc. all of that shit exists throughout life. it never ends after high school. it exists in college, the workplace, everywhere. the only time it doesn't exist is infancy.

Now if you tell me you never saw these things happen after high school, you probably did. You just don't remember it because you've been taught all your life that it doesn't exist so, as a result, if you witness it after high school, you won't remember it or recognize it for it what it is or at least won't recognize it as often as it actually happens (you won't recognize the bullying you witness as bullying or won't recognize the gossip you witness as gossip). When you are told something over and over by society, you develop a subconscious confirmation bias. If you notice anything that debunks or refutes what you've been taught, you won't remember it but will easily recall anything you witness that reinforces what you've been taught by society. A good example of this is that a fair amount of workplace bullying victims don't even recognize what happened as bullying, perhaps because they are taught by society that bullying doesn't exist after high school anymore. Thus, they don't recognize the workplace bully as a true bully.

And saying ""I've never seen or experienced these things after college"" is an anecdotal fallacy. Anecdotes aren't real evidence. Let's rely on empirical and statistical evidence. Keep that in mind.

Bullying

Studies have shown that bullying happens more frequently in elementary school and middle school than in high school contrary to this myth that it happens most in high school. It becomes less common in high school, and is less common in 12th grade compared to grades 9 to 11. Physical bullying also has been shown to decline by middle/high school, and becomes rare by that point, whereas relational bullying increases. It seems the overall prevalence of bullying decreases and decreases up until 12th grade, and then plateaus after high school. Workplace bullying, for example, is just as common, and affects many people. And if you think workplace bullying isn't as bad, you're wrong. Studies have shown links between workplace bullying and increased risk of cardio diseases, anxiety disorders (like PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder or panic attacks), depression, and suicidality. The worst thing about workplace bullying is that many times it can be your boss (and occasionally your co-workers).

And guess what? Bullying exists in college, too. I bet many college bullying victims don't recognize what happened to them as bullying because they're taught that bullying doesn't exist in college, so they don't recognize it for what it is when they get bullied in college. For example, some studies show that 21 to 25% of college students are bullied, some studies showing 15% are bullied, and even one study of 9,100 incoming freshmen at 8 college and universities in Midwestern United States, it found that 43% were bullied in college and 33% at work. When including people who were bullied only once, it found that 70% of college freshmen and 59% of them were bullied at least once at college or work, respectively. Also, some studies show that 1 to 11%, 19% or even as many as 22% of college students are cyberbullied.

Up to 60% of college students have witnessed another student get bullied. So why don't we hear about college bullying? because many victims of college bullies don't tell people about it because they feel they need to be independent and handle their own problems, so they don't get help, which means it is harder for them to get help in college than in high school. And many times the bully is a roommate or dorm-mate. Switching roommates and dormmates isn't good advice nor is walking away. Many college bullying victims can't get help for aforementioned reasons, and many people think college bullying doesn't exist so they won't believe them. so telling them to walk away or to switch roommates or move dorms or apartments is easier said than done. Also, many times bullying in college could happen between roommates or in other situations behind closed doors or when nobody else is around, so people are less likely to witness it. Many college students, however, have witnessed it, but if many more high school students have witnessed it, this is the reason. In fact, some college students may have seen it but don't remember it because since they're taught all the time that it ends in college, they develop a subconscious confirmation bias where they don't recall witnessing college bullying because it goes against their confirmation bias, which was developed subconsciously due to being taught over and over that it ends after high school.

And guess what? Some college cyberbullying victims were cyberbullied in high school, too (35-50%). So if you're getting cyberbullied in HS, it might happen in college. and don't forget how common workplace cyberbullying is. As many as 100,000 college students drop out a year due to college bullies. And although many bullying victims stop being bullied after HS, studies show that they sometimes after bullied after HS:



Developmental research suggests there is continuity between bully or victim status across childhood, adolescence, and into college (Chapell et al., 2006; Isaacs, Hodges, & Salmivalli, 2008). Among those who identify as bullies or victims of bullying during college, many have had similar experiences during primary and secondary school. Longitudinal studies of children and adolescents indicate that there is a moderate to strong relationship between being peer-nominated as a bully or a victim across different time points. One such study found that a child’s status as a bully or victim at age eight was positively correlated with their status at age 16 as well as in college (Sourander, Helstela, Helenius, & Piha, 2000). Additional studies have found support for the continuity of bullying experiences for both victims and perpetrators of bullying (Bauman & Newman, 2013; Chapell et al., 2006; Isaacs et al., 2008). These studies provide evidence of a relatively high level of continuity between in the experience of bullying across grade school through high school, and into college.

If you're being bullied in high school, you have a higher possibility of being bullied in college. And HS bullies might still bully in college, as shown in the quote above. In fact, research shows that 70% of people bullied in elementary school or high school are also bullied in college. 

And studies have also shown that school bullying victims also are more likely to be bullied in the workplace.

Popularity

Think the popular crowd doesn't exist after high school? Think again. They do exist after high school. Throughout life. They exist in college (Greek life duh) and they exist in the workplace. They exist on dating apps, where some people get more matches than others. Attractive people are popular in life. They receive so many benefits in life because they are attractive and ugly people receive disadvantages. Tall men are more popular and treated favorably than short men. White people are treated more favorably and receive more benefits in life than black people, who endure racism. These people are more popular because they are treated favorably.

In college, we do have popularity. I mean what the fuck resembles the popular people in high school? They're good looking, they have lots of friends, they party a lot and are extraverts. In college, Greek lifers resemble all those traits. All of it. They are literal clones of the jocks/cheerleaders in HS. Like jocks, frat boys are hypermasculine chick magnet chads who are good looking and get lots of women and throw ragers all day. And like cheerleaders, sorority girls are blond, attractive, skinny, party all day, take instagram pics and put it on social media for thousands of likes from horny men, etc. They all make friends easily by merely joining greek life, and they all party regularly and binge drink a lot and many frats/sororities won't allow you in if you can't attract the opposite gender enough or aren't pretty enough or handsome enough or are too shy. High school jocks jjust wanna win their football game. Frat boys want to throw the most popular parties and have formals with the hottest sororities, and they only allow in girls (they only allow exceptional guys) but not guys to prevent intrasexual competition. And I know you say that nobody will know who the greek lifers are or their names or will care who they are. well yeah, people DO care who they are, why else do people try to get into frat parties all the time? the only reason people stop going by junior year is because they now can throw their own off-campus house parties/apartment parties or go to bars by turning 21 so they don't need to rely on frats to party. but as a freshman/sophomore they all want to get into frat parties. And even if you don't know who they are or their names, you'll know they exist at the college, and you might even meet a few at the least when at college. hell, in some universities you might meet them regularly if you're at a southern or private uni which is infested with greek lifers. They party all the fucking time. and many college students experience FOMO because they worry they don't have as many friends as other college students, or don't have as much sex or hookups as other peers, or worry they don't party enough, and this bothers many college students. Many college students will say they don't care about their popularity if you were to ask, but actions speak louder than words. Just ask it differently, ask if they feel they don't have as many friends as others and want more, or if they have FOMO or wish they could experience more parties and other social events, and they'll say yes. that's how people might feel in HS too but even more so in college because there's more pressure to have sex, hook up, party or drink in college. Many college students envy those they think have a better college experience and greek lifers have the ultimate college experience. they might pay attention to other people in college they don't know, but they'll know those party people or greek lifers exist and envy their physical attractiveness and social success of large friend groups, attractive romantic partners, parties, and extroverted lives.

In a study, researchers examined the prevalence of popularity in college. The sample consists of 408 (297 women, 104 men) undergraduate students at a small liberal arts college. Participants took a short online Qualtrics survey and rated 61 potential descriptors of a popular person on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (a lot). These potential descriptors tapped into three dimensions 1) behavioral attributes (""is well liked"", ""is a leader"", ""is disliked"") 2) risk taking behaviors (""drinks alcohol"", ""has multiple sexual partners"", ""does drugs"") and 3) social media presence (""uses snapchat"", ""has lots of followers""). Participants were also asked to indicate the degree which they believed popularity exists in college on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (a lot). Most of the participants (86.3%) rated that popularity is a relevant part of the peer landscape in college. Three separate univariate factor analysis were conducted. Then, composite scores were made and used in the following analyses. Univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant gender and race effects (p < .05). Perceptions of the attributes associated with popularity varied as a function of gender and race. Women more than men believed that affluence, admiration, and social media presence were connected with popularity. Caucasians more than non-Caucasians believed that admiration, and sexual-, and drug-risk behaviors were connected with popularity. The results give a better understanding of the peer social landscape among young adults in college and how popularity appears different from previous stages in development.

Even research shows and confirms popularity's existence in college and emerging adulthood (18-25 year olds).

In a research paper about popularity in college, it revealed:




""Drug risk. Social and counterculture crowd affiliations positively predicted drug-related risk-taking behaviors, whereas scholastic and athletic crowd affiliations negatively predicted drug-related risk-taking behaviors.
Academic risk. Counterculture crowd affiliation positively predicted academic-related risk-taking behaviors, whereas scholastic crowd affiliation negatively predicted academic-related risk-taking behaviors.
Alcohol risk. Social and counterculture crowd affiliations positively predicted alcohol-related risk-taking behaviors, whereas scholastic crowd affiliation negatively predicted alcohol-related risk-taking behaviors.
Sex risk. Social and counterculture crowd affiliations positively predicted sex-related risk-taking behaviors
Social–emotional adjustment. Counterculture crowd affiliation positively predicted loneliness, whereas social, athletic, and scholastic crowd affiliations negatively predicted loneliness. Social and scholastic crowd affiliations positively predicted college belongingness, whereas counterculture affiliation negatively predicted college belongingness.""

In a research paper by authors Tessa A M Lansu and Antonius H N Cillessen, they wrote:




""There is no good reason to assume that social interaction and social hierarchy lose their valence in emerging adulthood. It is believed that throughout adult life, social relationships remain influential, affecting self-esteem, health, and leading to 'social pain,' that shares common physiological mechanisms with physical pain, when one is socially excluded. Evidence that social status is particularly salient in emerging adult- hood comes from findings of LaFontana and Cillessen (2010), who find both late adolescents (Grades 9-12) and emerging adults (Grades 13-16) to prioritize enhancing popularity over other social goals including romantic relation- ships. The fact that emerging adults are more likely to prioritize status enhancement over romantic relationships and rule adherence than adolescents indicates that peer status plays a large role in the social decision making of emerging adults.""

""Together, these findings suggest that peer status in a school setting in emerging adulthood is quite similar to peer status in adolescence. Research with younger age groups has shown consistently that preference is associated with prosocial traits and behaviors only, whereas popularity is associated with a mixture of prosocial and antisocial traits and behaviors. Exactly the same happened in the current emerging adult sample: Preference was related to being prosocial and included but not aggressive. Popularity was related to being prosocial and included and aggressive. The consistency of these results in an 18- to 25-year-old sample with results found across the 10- to 18-year age range is remarkable and points to a universality of the structure of the peer group across a wide age range. These findings also lead to the conclusion that power is still a salient part of group dynamics in emerging adulthood.""

And the workplace also has popular people too:

Research has shown that the popularity we experience as a teen in high school is not different at all from the popularity and status we experience in the workplace as adults later in life. This article explains it further. Some co-workers are very popular and have high status/likeability. And it's similar to what you see in HS.

And we have new hierarchies appear after HS too like job hierarchies and money hierarchies, with homeless people or low-income people envying the rich. and janitors envying white collar workers

Cliques

Anyone who tells you this shit ends after high school is utterly retarded. People get cliquer as you get older. Universities have cliques all the time. In high school, everyone knows each other so everyone talks to each other, even their acquiantances. In college, if you ain't their friend, they ignore you. When you're a transfer student, everyone has their own peer group by now and nobody wants new friends. they won't be your friend even if you have a lot in common. Greek lifers hang out with other greek lifers. computer science and honors students hang out with each other. the party people hang out with party people. people hang out with their own race. cliques exist in college. and many idiots will say that everyone is more open minded in college or more accepting of those who are different. well with bullying still common in college and the fact that people are even cliquier in college than HS, i beg to differ. if you aren't just like them, they don't wanna be friends and if they have their friend group, having a lot in common with them won't even help. And workplace cliques exist too. Many people say their office has cliques. and the ones who didn't say that, probably still had cliques in their office and they don't recognize it for what it is because they're taught it ends after HS. And as you get older, people finished forming their circle of friends and nobody wants new friends. As you get older it becomes harder making friends and that's one of the reasons alongside the fact it's harder to meet people. even coworkers have their own friend group by now that they established and don't want new friends. people become cliquier and cliquier as you get older because as you get older people are more likely to have their own established friend group.

Rumors and gossip

A lot of dumbasses think this shit ends after high school. it never ends. Studies show most co-workers gossip and they gossip on average 40 min per week. They gossip about other coworkers most of the time and sometimes the executive/management team. And at uni, i heard people gossip/start rumors much more than i heard people gossip or start rumors in HS. this shit doesn't end, anyone who thinks that it does is a moron.

Peer pressure

This definitely exists in college. There's more pressure to drink, fuck and party or hook up in college than in HS. and if you think peer pressure doesn't exist in college, well it self-evidently does. even at parties you can receive flak if you don't drink. and that ain't the only example. Even in later life, peer pressure exists, but its more subtle but it still exists. Even in the workplace it exists.

None of these things end after high school. They exist after high school and before high school. The only life stage they don't exist in is infancy. To all the youngcels thinking its hard, it doesn't get better. Studies have shown that adult virgins often were bullied, socially withdrawn and ostracized or socially withdrawn growing up, and are less satisifed with their social life in adulthood than other adults. It doesn't get better. Humans never mature. This is a myth just to cheer outcasts up. And peaking in high school is a myth. Bullying victims and outcasts studies show are more likely to be obese throughout adulthood and live in poverty or suffer mental problems in adulthood. Here's more information about what really happens to popular people later in life. they don't become fat hobos like in movies. it's a myth. Research shows high school athletes have better grades and better jobs in the future (same with cheerleaders).

TLDR: high school never ends. popular people, rumors, gossip, peer pressure, drama, cliques, exclusion, bullies, etc exist throughout life. and life satisfaction plummets after your teenage years. These studies didn't show people under 15. Apparently life satisfaction reaches its very peak at ages 10-12 then falls in the teen years, and falls more after the teen years. no study shows people under 10, i bet its higher for people under 10.

But heres the kicker, FACE= SOCIAL STATUS




we found that even after controlling for other variables such as when the respondents were born, their level of education and their parents’ social status, people with more attractive faces tended to start out in higher-status jobs

The effect, it seems, remains constant throughout men’s and women’s career histories – there was no significant difference in the impact of beauty as they aged and progressed in their careers. In other words, facial attractiveness is as important in determining people’s occupational prestige at the beginning of their careers as it is in the middle or at the end.

Manlet cutoff is 6ft according to study (heightpill),Blackpill,13k,"Mar 24, 2018",15000,58,"the study and source:
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_03/sr03_039.pdf#page22

as you can see from the study, MEDIAN height for white males aged 20-40 is 178.3cm in the United States. Note that this also includes old ass dudes who already lost 1-2 inches and the fact that old generation arent as tall as new generation. If you take a guess for only 18-23 yo white males, the healthy estimate for young white male median height is 183.(6ft). You are LITERALLY shorter than majority of young white males if you are not above 6ft.

And this is only for united states, for western europe you can add another inch to that 183cm. and you get THE MEDIAN height as 6'1''-6'2'' for young white males.

In the west you aint mogging shit with 6'1''. You will be barely average amoung your competition (deathnics not included of course, it was always over for us.) The ideal height is around 6'4''.

As studies confirm it as they show 6'2-6'7'' males get most matches on online dating.

Now, I agree height is not as important as face and race but of course that is not the point."
"[Brutal] The origins of modern ""dating"" culture and the feminist ""sexual marketplace"" are to be found in prostitution",Blackpill,Atavistic Autist,"Jan 15, 2020",6000,18,"-- Dual mating strategy was conceived of as early as the 19th century 

Ninon de L'Enclos was perhaps the most prominent courtesan of Renaissance France, a prostitute who services high-end clients. She was unique in that she asserted control over the process of her work and adopted an assertive role rather than a submissive one.

If you were part of Parisian high society and wanted to have sex with Ninon, you had one of two options: you could either become a ""payer,"" and help subsidize her hedonistic lifestyle and philosophical expoundings on Epicureanism, or else become what she termed a ""martyr"" -- her friend!


As a payer, you were not entitled to consistent and speedy sex, in the manner of traditional prostitution, but sex only on her terms. The affections she gave you could come as irregularly as once a month, or as frequently as once a week. She decided when she wanted to have sex with you.

As a martyr, you would most likely be left completely sexless and blueballed in her salon, signaling how anticlerical and libertine you were in the hopes that she would notice you. However, Ninon would select one man among the ranks of her friends to serve as her favorite. She'd have sex with him on a consistent basis, for free, but this relationship would rarely last longer than a month.


Payers are clearly analogues to beta providers/hubbies who only get sex once a month in exchange for their finances. Those payers who enjoyed more frequent sex than the others are comparable to sugar daddies.

Martyrs are clearly analogues to friendzoned beta orbiters (to call them martyrs was a brutal insult not just to religious morality but to their own dignity). Favorites are ""friends with benefits"" or ""boyfriends"" who enjoy sex with a woman who is attracted to them for as long as the honeymoon phase lasts.


I posit that the dynamics of modern ""dating"" culture and the ""sexual marketplace"" is rooted in these sorts of innovations that prostitution underwent among the decadent aristocracy, and that they have since trickled down and become customary for the common people. The mechanistic language of a romantic date or a sexual marketplace itself is clearly inspired by the mechanistic nature of prostitution.

Feminism originates among privileged women like Ninon de L'Enclos, who were spared the proletarian toils of marriage and fully embraced the deracination of their class. Her way of dealing with men as a prostitute is now typical for everyday thots."
Applied Black Pill 101,Blackpill,based_meme,"Dec 12, 2022",5000,36,"You've lived it, you've experienced it, you've learned the theory, you've read the studies, and you've seen the statistics. You know deep in the pit of your stomach that it's over. You are black pilled - on women, on dating and relationships, on school and work, and on life and the world at large.

OK, now what? What are you going to do with the fact you're black pilled? The philosophy has helped you see more of reality, and every bit of it is brutal. But exactly what the hell are you supposed to do with that knowledge? You've heard the old saying, ""knowledge is power."" The black pill is just that: knowledge, but stripped away of the bullshit. So then, how do you use that in your every day? What can you do? Primarily, you can protect yourself.

Imagine you're a 18-20 year old on his last year of school or entering college uni. Some of you don't have to imagine, because you're already there. You're a cub out in the wilds - green, naive, and wet behind the ears. You awkwardly try to make friends and talk to girls. You find a cute girl you think you can stand a chance with and ask out. If you're black pilled, you can save yourself the embarrassment and heartache of developing a oneitis, only to get crushed by the weight of the world. What would happen if you're not black pilled? 

Once you finally muster up the courage to ask her out, only to get rejected, humiliated, become the topic of gossip, and potentially ostracized from future social events (people talk, they always do), you will know that you never should thought of doing something so stupid. You could become depressed, have your grades sink, lose your scholarship, your friends (or people whom you thought were friends), and might even be driven to become the successor to General Cho. You will learn the hard way, and that lesson will stay with you for life. 

If you're blue pilled, we all know how that story goes. There are some poor, blue pilled cuck faggots here still struggling with the emotional grips of their oneitis. JFL. The black pill can protect you from this emotional pain and trauma.

Let's move on to where you're 25-30 and are at a career type of job. If you're in the gynocentric West, your workplace is likely to be majority female in most offices. If you're blue pilled, you're probably going to try and talk to your coworkers to try and fit in, not realizing that you're looks have already placed you low on the social ladder, and that the effects of this spill over to the professional domain. Some females might start asking you for work favors and fake being nice to get you to comply. In your blue pilled state, you will start wondering if she's interested in you (she's not). You continue to do favors like the good office dog that you've let yourself become and people see you as. 

Then one day, on a Friday at noon, you decide that this is the perfect time for you to make your move and ask Jenni from client relations what her weekend plans are and if she wants to go out with you to this upcoming music show you're hyped about later that night. Of course, she expected you to ask her out sometime because you've been showing your signs of interest in her like pins and name tags on your business casual shirt for the past six weeks. She quickly spits out her rehearsed bullshit about visiting her bestie over the weekend who lives several hours drive away in another town. 

Monday rolls around and you notice that all of the women in the office are suddenly much colder towards you. You sit down at your work desk, open your email, and you see an urgent email from your boss saying to visit her office ASAP. Your boss sits you down and says that HR has brought forward to her concerns about your office behaviour towards female coworkers. This completely blindsides you and you're left flabbergasted. You're shocked, confused, partly angry, and every bit of it shows (because you have no poker face). Over the next few months your work deteriorates because everyone in the office is ignoring and snubbing you, and you're overtly not feeling welcome there. Your quarterly or semi-annual review comes up and your manager brings up your lacking workplace performance and warns that if this continues you will be let go. This obviously affects your work further and makes things worse for you. You become angry, depressed, resentful towards your female coworkers, and everything negative in your life compounds as a consequence. Eventually you're fired when there are one too many straws on that camel's back.

When you're black pilled you know the deal and the score. You know that you're there to do a job, that nobody there is your friend, and that people will step all over you if it means it will make them look good professionally and advance their career so you need to watch out for yourself. The black pill here can protect your career, your reputation, and potentially your freedom.

These are two key examples, which are all too prevalent in the lives of many young males, where knowledge of black pill can save you from a lot of pain and trouble. Whether you're a LDAR doomer or coping and living the best life you can, you can find ways to apply the black pill in areas of your life."

"r/IncelTear femoid writes about her own incel brother's depression: ""His disability is a barrier for many women""",Blackpill,PPEcel,"Sep 7, 2022",33000,214,"The femoid's post on r/TrueOffMyChest pretty much says it all.

EDIT: Screenshots because the fragile femoid deleted the post.



First things first, does someone know who her brother might be? Let's get him on the site ASAP; That is, if one of our recruiters hasn't already roped him in , because it does sound like he's already distant from his sister . This is supposedly u/TodaySensitive9743 herself, for reference:



Right. Now let's get down to the main point of this thread. You have a wheelchaircel who has never been in a relationship. She doesn't say anything about sex, but I'm inferring from the post that he's a virgin. Despite this, he's held onto the bluepill for almost 40 years. Forty. Fucking. Years. 

I suppose Wheelchaircel told himself that as long as he was interesting (""traveled the world on his own"") and had ""a good sense of humor"" and ""a lot of respect"", he would be able to overcome his disability and find a long-term partner. Now that he's aging, this sheer cope is crumbling before his very eyes, as his younger siblings hit developmental and personal milestones that he never will.

u/TodaySensitive9743 herself confesses that he's ""one of the people [she] admires the most in [her] life,"" yet she ""[doesn't] know how to handle this"".

I don't have to point out how ironic it is that, just five days before the Wheelchaircel post, she wrote a lengthy screed about how incels don't understand how it's purportedly our behavior driving femoids away:



Has u/TodaySensitive9743 tried giving her disabled older brother a condescending lecture with the same advice?  Has she tried telling her own brother, as many feminists have done, that he's a genetic abomination and that it's only fair for femoids to select the fittest of the species?

It's almost as if people experience varying levels of romantic success/failure for variables well beyond their control—like their race, facial structure, height, and yes, their physical and mental disabilities. Maybe, just maybe, the core tenets of the blackpill are in fact accurate:

There exists a gendered hierarchy of attractiveness that determine one's sexual market value (SMV).
The variables that determine sexual attractiveness are largely genetic and therefore immutable.
Because femoids have hypergamous mate preferences, a certain number of men (e.g. Wheelchaircel here) have such low SMV that it is irrational for them to even consider participating in the sexual market. They should just give up because they are destined for crushing rejection and failure.
These are, in fact, undeniable truths about dating and society in general. It's blindingly obvious, even to a child, that some genetic traits are prized by virtually all societies, and other traits are mocked and despised. Yet this is taboo to even acknowledge in our woke societies. Feminists will order that you agree with them that even the poorest disabled man is more privileged than the wealthiest able-bodied woman, and they'll label you a misogynist if you disagree.

Wheelchaircel here has evidently been a victim of society's gaslighting. He should have given up and decided to rot long ago. Now he's experiencing the withdrawal symptoms of the bluepill.

This entire thread serves as evidence that you can't engage with those retards. They genuinely live in a constant state of cognitive dissonance.

Her brother is a living confirmation of the blackpill. As you've rightfully highlighted, she herself stated he's pleasant. He clearly doesn't hold incel beliefs. He's apparently ""handsome"", which probably means he's not deformed and well-groomed.

Despite that, he's still an Incel. He didn't choose his fate, but he is one.
He'll die a depressed cripple with nobody who'd even look at him romantically. That's what he's going to take to the grave: Pain, suffering and isolation.

""Just wait till your 30s bro""
""Just wait till your 40s bro""
""Have a great personality""
""Be confident""

She's running out of bluepills which is why she even acknowledges that therapy won't help him. She knows there's no ""solution"" for his problem. The least she could do is assist him in killing himself but she's too much of a pretentious self-centered whore to even do that so he'll have to suffer until he dies to keep her happy.

It's fucked.

"Why its possible to be simultaneously bluepilled and successful in life: The life of ""Incel"" Tesla vs ""normie"" Edison",Story,ResidentHell,"Apr 4, 2023",9000,52,"Why is it possible to be bluepilled and successful in life? The bluepill can become a 'self-fulfilling prophecy' when a person receives constant support and positive reinforcement from others in their social environment. As an outcome of the ""halo effect"", a person can be deemed as high-value by others in the social milieu due to their genetics, lineage, economic wealth, social status or dark-triad personality

There's no real incentive for a person to even gravitate towards a  idea about the human world when things happen to fall in place for them which involve positive reinforcement, attention and validation from other people in their social area

The only reason why a person can be enabled to achieve a  understanding of the human world, is due to the emotional effects of ostracizarion, harassment, ridicule, neglection, condescension, dishonesty, being portrayed or labelled as a kind of threatening or hostile object (e.g. ""creep"", ""evil"", ""ill"", ""wicked"") and other forms of anti-social treatment - All of which will either have been directly experienced or witnessed by the affected person

A person's success is normally enabled by the support which they receive from other people. To such a degree that the person may never achieve success without the assistance they receive from other people. Usually the path to success is enabled by the support and approval of other people who are willing and prepared to provide it. No one succeeds on their own. Their actions must be validated and approved by the appropriate parties that will enable them to climb the ladder to success (e.g. peers with connections in the social realm, job recruiters, potential clients with economic resources to spare, experienced people in specified industry, higher-ups in specified industry). Without such validation and acceptance from the appropriate parties, the person's actions would be futile. Their actions would not bring significant results, and their path to success would be hindered or cut off altogether


The life of ""Incel"" Nikola Tesla vs The life ""Normie"" Thomas Edison

The life of Nikola Tesla is a prime example of how ideas and talents that are capable of major success, can be rendered fruitless without validation and support from the right people

Tesla invented various machines and devices, some of which were more advanced than British and American made devices at the time. Plus one of his inventions was alleged to be capable of mass destruction (aka the ""death ray""). Yet, he was barely acknowledged for his contribution to the field of scientific inventions during his lifetime. Instead, normies labelled him as a ""maniac"" and rejected his propositions about new scientific inventions. It's been said that had Tesla's ideas been accepted and supported by other people in his lifetime, humanity would have been more scientifically and technologically advanced than it currently is to date






Nikola Tesla Inventions - Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe


Nikola Tesla inventions constitute numerous technological breakthroughs throughout his lifetime.




teslasciencecenter.org





Conversely, normie inventor Thomas Edison, he received much more social validation and acceptance for his inventions than Tesla - In spite of the fact that Tesla's inventions were more advanced than Edison's, and Tesla had ideas that Edison wasn't familiar with. As normie Edison had more favour with the British and American public, his ideas were easily accepted, and people were readily prepared to support Edison in development of invenriona. Whereas incel Tesla received virtually no support in development of his ideas. He did most of his research alone, and most of his inventions went unpublicized until decades after his death

In spite of how normies treated Tesla in his lifetime, he was miles ahead of normie Edison in scientific inventions. Normie Edison and incel Tesla were both different in their approach to inventions. Tesla had a mathematical and scientific approach to invention. In his thought, he would formulate the perfect model of his invention and ensure it was systematically flawless before he would create the material product. Whereas Edison was a ""trial-and-error"" inventor. He made hundreds of different versions of an invention until he established the most viable version of his invention through the ""trial-and-error"" process

However normie Edison stubbornly rejected the suggestion that he should be more logical and scientific about his approach to invention. Instead he relied on his ""inventor instinct"" and the ""American way"". Even Tesla once said that he pitifully watched Edison as he rigorously attempted to improve one of his inventions, when Tesla already knew a simple scientific solution to improve the invention that involved much less effort and no need for ""trial-and-error""

A quote from Tesla about the ineffectiveness of normie Edison's approach to his invention process:




His method was inefficient in the extreme, for an immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and, at first, I was almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90 percent of the labor. But he had a veritable contempt for book learning and mathematical knowledge, trusting himself entirely to his inventor's instinct and practical American sense

Normie Edison received thousands of patents for his inventions, even though his ideas were less advanced than incel Tesla. Whereas incel Tesla made various attempts to patent his ideas, but only a few hundred of his inventions would be successfully patented. Most of Tesla's ideas were constantly rejected by investors and patent offices. Also some of Tesla's ideas would later be patented to other normies who were neither as intelligent nor creative as him, like Westinghouse.

The ""Alternating Current"" was one of Tesla's most well-known inventions; Tesla's version of AC was more advanced than Edison's version of AC. But Tesla was deceived by Edison who falsely promised him a financial reward of $50,000 for fixing the flaws in Edison's AC design. Initially, incel Tesla provided support to normie Edison, but would discontinue support after six months when it became clear that normie Edison wouldn't deliver on his promise to incel Tesla. On top of that, Edison said the promise of financial reward was a ""practical joke"" and that Tesla didn't understand ""American humor"" (JFL at how the Americans treated Tesla)

When Tesla attempted to patent his AC design in the USA, he was rejected on every attempt. The patent for Tesla's AC was later licensed under Westinghouse (now known as the world-famous CBS Corporation), but on the condition that Tesla worked for Westinghouse. However Tesla would have to renounce his royalty rights to his own AC design that was patented under Westinghouse, after complications emerged in the process of contract re-negotiation with investors

After Tesla abandoned his support for Edison's company, his financial situation deteriorated --- To the point he became a wagie for $2 a day at various electrical repair jobs, because US investors backed out of support for Tesla's AC design. This left Tesla's company in bankruptcy and Tesla eventually became financially broke. All the while normie Edison was gigamogging him in the financial world and the sex / relationship world

An extract from the linked article about how incel Tesla was underhandedly treated by normie Edison and other American normies:




When Tesla came to the United States, he worked for Thomas Edison in Manhattan and was promised $50,000 if he could make Edison’s direct current method successful. As it turned out, Edison’s DC current was not as effective as Tesla’s own alternating current method in transmitting electricity over long distances. When Edison reneged on his offer to pay Tesla to solve his DC power design flaws, Tesla quit and moved on to his next endeavor. Tesla applied for many patents for his AC power discoveries which were later sold to Westinghouse. AC power has been widely used since its discovery and still has some applications in radio and television transmission.

An extract from Nikola Tesla's Wikipedia about how he was played by US investors for his AC design and became broke as a result. This was shortly after he left normie Edison's company due to Edison's failure to reward Tesla with the promised $50,000 for assistance to his company:




The investors showed little interest in Tesla's ideas for new types of alternating current motors and electrical transmission equipment. After the utility was up and running in 1886, they decided that the manufacturing side of the business was too competitive and opted to simply run an electric utility. They formed a new utility company, abandoning Tesla's company and leaving the inventor penniless. Tesla even lost control of the patents he had generated, since he had assigned them to the company in exchange for stock. He had to work at various electrical repair jobs and as a ditch digger for $2 per day. Later in life Tesla recounted that part of 1886 as a time of hardship, writing ""My high education in various branches of science, mechanics and literature seemed to me like a mockery""

Imagine having an idea that would completely transform the communication systems of human society, but be constantly rejected by normies for this idea until they validate and patent the exact same idea, but under the name of someone else. Plus the royalties that you receive from the product that was your own invention (but was patented under the name of another normie) are eventually stopped due to legal complications that emerged in review of the contract by investors. Then when you launched your own company to sell the product of this idea, investors failed to provide financial support. In effect your company becomes bankrupt and you become financially broke, to the degree that you descend as low as wagie for $2 a day at various jobs

This is a perfect example of how a plan or idea that was primed to bring about a person's ""success"", can be rendered futile without the appropriate level of support, validation and acceptance from the right people. An idea for a communication system that would revolutionize the human world - But was obstructed by the powers that would otherwise have enabled him to be successful, and didn't receive the support he needed to propel his inventions to commercial success on a worldwide scale. But why did they do this to Tesla? Why did they inhibit him from being as successful and validated as his American counterpart, normie Edison?

Personally, I would say the life of Nikola Tesla was one of the most insufferable lives to have ever been lived by any famous person in human history. Because in spite of his extensive efforts to various inventions that were ahead of his time, he was not really recognized for his contribution to the field of scientific inventions in his lifetime. Instead he was insulted and rejected by normies for his ideas until he died. Plus other people were later credited and patented for inventions that he had already conceived beforehand

Between incel Tesla and normie Edison, Tesla was more innovative and more intelligent. Yet Edison lifemogged Tesla beyond comparison - Edison received multiple times the amount of patents that Tesla received. Edison was wealthy for pretty much his entire life, while Tesla was forced to become a wagie for peanuts and died broke. Edison married prime cunny twice, while Tesla became an overlord wizard and died alone with his virginity 

Even in death, the circumstances around normie Edison's death mogged the circumstances around incel Tesla's death. Edison died in the comfort of his family home while accompanied by his second wife and children. While Tesla died in a hotel room, alone, financially broke and without human companionship - Only for his body to be discovered TWO DAYS later by a hotel maid, his hotel room searched by the FBI, and HIS PERSONAL BELONGINGS (including his research notes) SEIZED BY THE FBI. Considering how brutal was the life of incel Tesla, it would have made total sense for him to have  ideas about the human world based on his own life experience

To be constantly rejected, ridiculed and dishonestly treated by normies for having ideas that would later prove to be revolutionary to their own world as well as the world of their descendants --- How can one not gravitate towards the  after enduring a lifetime of such unfair and hostile treatment by normies in the social world? What did Tesla do to receive such treatment from normies?

Perhaps it was because he was a immigrant from the Austrian Empire, a region that bordered the communist rivals of USA. If that's the case, it would be a clear example of how involuntary factors in one's life can directly impact their chances of success, in spite of whatever talent, skill, idea or willpower / determination they may possess. Was it Tesla's fault he was born near a country that rivals the USA? Exactly what factors contributed to the anti-social treatment of Tesla in his lifetime that were completely within his own control? If I had to take a wild guess, I'd say none. IMO the reason Tesla was ridiculed, rejected and dishonestly treated by normies, was because he had certain traits and factors about his human existential situation that weren't within his full control


So whats the takeaway here?

A bluepilled successful person can be rendered mentally unable to fathom that the worlds of two different people can be completely different in their entirety. They can't understand that some events that are feasible in one person's world, can be unlikely or virtually impossible to happen in the other person's world. As the world of a bluepilled successful person would involve constant positive reinforcement and social validation from others, it would be difficult for them to gravitate towards the  even if they wanted to. Because there would be no real incentive for them to gravitate to  based on their own experiences in social life and the social environment

The only true way for a person to become  is by direct experience of harrasment, rejection, ostracization, demonization, bullying and other forms of anti-social behavior. Without such experience of anti-social behaviour, it would be virtually impossible to obtain the  mindset (except for low IQ people that become , mainly due to their primitive / animalistic mentality, their deficiency of rational thought, and their failure or non-opportunity to be effectively domesticated for interaction with the outside social world)

A bluepilled successful person would be inclined to use confirmation bias to rationalize their belief that its possible for others to become successful like them. For example, ""If I was able to do it, then so can you"". They experience a few major sucesses in life and think they know it all. So they give you bluepilled or redpilled shit - When in reality its not that simple, because usually, no one succeeds on their own. A successful idea is useless without the backing and investment received from other parties that are able to provide it. The life story of Nikola Tesla is a solid example of this. The pathway to success is most often enabled by the support received from peers, investors and other third parties. To such a degree that success would have never been made possible without the investment and support received from those other parties

There can be external factors / conditions that people are involuntarily subjected to - To such a degree that these involuntary factors / conditions can have direct influence over the outcomes of people's lives, depending how much the person is affected by these factors / conditions, as well as the type of environment in which these factors / conditions have affected them. This is what bluepillers and redpillers seem to consistently fail to understand. Bluepillers and redpillers like to assume that willpower and self-determination can overcome any kind of adversity or systemic structure. But some conditions in life can be involuntary / uncontrollable, and they can directly impact the course of a person's biological life and social life simultaneously

Sometimes it may not be easy to succeed, and the amount of effort required to succeed in something can be underestimated. For some things, a high degree of determination, dedication and persistence may be required to become successful. Also mentality can have a direct impact on how you act as well as your preferred choice of action. If you think you are worthless and have no importance to other people in the social world, your behavior will correlate with this anti-social / low self-esteem mindset. The same way, if you think you have social value or resourceful value to other people in the social world, your behavior will correlate with this pro-social / high self-esteem mindset

However, an unpleasant fact about life that bluepillers and redpillers fail to accept is that sometimes, involuntary / uncontrollable factors in a person's existential situation can ultimately overcome their willpower and determination to succeed. To have a ""success plan"" is never enough without support and validation from the appropriate people. Whether other people are ready to validate you and provide assistance in the achievement of your ambitions, can depend on factors that are totally beyond your own control. Even though ""manifesting of thoughts"" can be relevant to a person's self-esteem and determination to succeed --- The ""manifestation of thought"" can be useless. Because, the influence of structures & systems in the biological / social world can ultimately overpower ""ambition"", ""determination"", ""willpower"", ""self-perception"" and all other facets of 


A summary of ""incel"" Tesla's life


A US immigrant born in the Austrian Empire (now Croatia), which used to be located next to another region that was ruled by rivals of the US. A university dropout, was transient in his early adult years. Ironically his height peaked at 6""2
Wasn't known to have had a romantic or sexual history with women. Apparently became a wizard. Most likely died a virgin
Fell in love with a pigeon. Compared his love for the pigeon to a heterosexual romance between male and female humans. Most likely did this to compensate for the lack of human affection he received in his lifetime
Claimed his lifetime of celibacy helpled him to improve his scientific abilities
A scientific inventor of various devices. Including suspected WMDs, communication systems that would revolutionize the human world, and other devices that were ahead of the British & American standard at the time. Also his inventions were more advanced than normie Edison's inventions and other inventors from his era. Arguably the most underrated inventor in human history
Had a scientific approach to innovation. Would formulate a systematic model for an invention in his thought and ensure it was mathematically viable before the creation of the material product of his invention. His approach to innovation turned out to be more effective than normie Edison's approach
Only 300 of his inventions were patented worldwide. Some of his patents were lost to stock exchanges in return for publicly tradeable company shares
Failed to recieve a patent for most of his ideas in spite of several attempts to convince investors and patent offices. Some of his inventions would later be patented under the titles of other normies who were neither as intelligent nor as creative as him (such as Westinghouse)
Predicted the rise of gynocentrism and the dominance of feminist culture in modern society. Has a personal disdain for landwhales and has expressed disapproval of sexually suggestive dress codes in women. Also suggested the increase in woman's rights and freedom will have a dysgenic impact on the future of human society
An advocate of the practice of eugenics. Believes subhumans should be sterilized or restricted in their sexual freedom
Manipulated by normie Edison into providing assistance for his work-in-progress inventions. Was promised by normie Edison that he would be financially rewarded for his assistance, but normie Edison would eventually fail to deliver on his end of the agreement. Also described normie Edison as ""boring"", ""unhygenic"", ""unwilling to learn from book reading"" and ""unwilling to improve his mathematical intellect""
His company went bankrupt after US investors backed out of support for his AC design, even though his AC design was the most advanced in the world at the time. Had to wagie for $2 a day at various electrical repair jobs
Died alone in a hotel room. He was broke when he died. His dead body was discovered two days later by a maid who worked at the hotel. His room was searched due to suspicions of foul play. Also his personal belongings and research notes were seized by the FBI. Many of his research notes were destroyed in seperate incidents. The research notes the FBI managed to recover from his place of residence, were withheld from the public domain for almost a century (JFL fucking brutal). Was cremated and his ashes were placed on display in a museum named after him


A summary of ""normie"" Edison's life


A US citizen born and raised in the USA. A wealthy entrepeneur and claimed he was self-educated (he was home-schooled). His height peaked at 5""11
Had two wives and at least six children in his lifetime
His first wife was 16 and he was 20 when they married. His second wife was 20 and he was 39 when they married
A scientific inventor who's regarded as the most prolific inventor in US history. Even though, his inventions were not as advanced as Tesla, and was not as scientifically intelligent as Tesla
Rejected the scientific approach to innovation. Instead used ""trial-and-error"" method to achieve the final model of his inventions. Relied on his ""inventor pride"" and the ""American way"" to guide him, rather than scientific and mathematical resources. His approach to innovation turned out to be less effective than incel Tesla's approach
Approximately 2000 of his inventions received patents worldwide, 1000 of which were in the United States
A supporter of woman's suffrage and signed a petition that supported the early waves of pro-feminist political movement (no surprise there for a redpiller who was successful in the social, economic and dating world his entire life)
Promised incel Tesla a financial reward for his assistance in development of scientific inventions. Ultimately failed to deliver on his promise to incel Tesla. Said the promise was a ""practical joke"" and that incel Tesla didn't understand ""American humor""
Died in the comfort of his family home - The same home he purchased for his second wife. Was accompanied by his second wife and children in his death. As a memento of his highly esteemed life, his last breath was preserved in a tube and placed on display in a US historical museum. Also a plaster death mask and casts of his hands were made. His funeral was lead by his best friend who was also a church reverend


Unironically, if you see the famous quotes of Edison and Tesla, you'll notice a stark difference between the themes of their famous quotes - Many of Edison's famous quotes are generic  shit about determination and hard work to achieve success (e.g. ""never give up"", ""just try one more time"", ""keep working towards your goals and dreams"", ""success doesn't come without hard work"" (JFL Tell that to internet whores who charge for messages, phone calls, pictures, video clips and organic waste), ""every failure is a step closer to success"", ""success is based on ambition and desire to work"")

Whereas Tesla's famous quotes are more  in nature. Many of Tesla's famous quotes allude to the default / uncontrollable conditions of physical existence, as well as how these default / uncontrollable conditions can directly impact the course of an organism's life (e.g. the dangers of subhumanity in the human species, the automatic impact of EM waves on organic life, the fallacy of love, the detrimental effects of living without human affection, the impracticality of success without validation and support from external forces)

If normie Edison's life was more like incel Tesla's, I'm sure that normie Edison's famous quotes would have been less  /  and more  in nature. The same way, had incel Tesla's life been more like normie Edison's, incel Tesla's famous quotes would have been more  /  and less  in nature

Look at the history of Tesla's life and compare it with the history of Edison's life. Consider that incel Tesla, who's ideas and talents were ahead of normie Edison, was cheated, berated, rejected by normies, and was left broke, alone and a wizard by the time he died --- Despite this, Tesla's ideas would later prove to be a world-revolutionary commercial success. But even then, normie Edison totally lifemogged Tesla in every aspect of the economical, sexual and social world

It's this simple: Even if you have talent or the most advanced ideas in the world - The pathway to success can be rendered impossible without the validation, acceptance and appropriate level of support from the right people. Plus even if you have a practical idea that's primed for commercial success, your ability to obtain the rewards of your commercially successful idea can be hindered in result of rejection, oppression, neglection, dishonesty and other complications caused by people in the social world

When you compare the life of Tesla to the life of Edison --- It's insane how the most intelligent and most creative of people can be the least validated, least respected people in the society of their era. It's insane how normies can insult and ostracize the smartest people, but validate and worship less intelligent people at the same time. I guess that's just the life of a high IQ wizard compared with the life of a mid / low IQ normie lifemogger.

Redpillers will tell you success is possible for all who try as long as they are highly determined, restless and strong in effort. What they won't tell you is that there are structures in many areas of activity related to the world of society - That are designed or set in such a way that only the minority can excel, while the majority would either struggle and fail, or they will achieve but at a mediocre or subpar level

Redpillers will tell you all about the stories of people who were destitute and lacked in resources, but eventually succeeded through determination and rigorous effort. But they won't tell you about the many other stories of people who tried and ultimately failed, because it does not fit the narrative of their  /  philosophy about life and the world. They won't tell you about the people who died trying to achieve success. They won't tell you about the people who were hindered or made unable to succeed due to external factors beyond their control that had a certain effect on their personal circumstances, like Tesla. They won't tell you about the people who were on the path to success, but were hindered or impeded by other people who had enough power to directly affect the person's circumstances, and impeded their pathway to success, like they did to Tesla

Redpillers will normally sell you the bullshit dream of ""any one can succeed as long as they are determined and try hard enough"". But blackpillers will tell you: The system / social structure can have an oppressive effect on a person's situation, to such a degree that even people with awesome ideas or a unique talent can be hindered or impeded from success due to oppression and rejection by others who already have a significant influence or status in the system / structure --- Just like how bluepillers are reluctant to recognize the horrible conditions of human existence in biological world, redpillers will be reluctant to come to terms with the reality of an oppressive structure that holds more weight than the ""power of ambition"" or ""determination"", because it directly contradicts their  philosophy

In life, a person can be talented with a physical or intellectual ability that has potential for success. But because they have insufficient access to essential resources, or are based in an unsuitable environment, their talent or ability may never manifest to its optimal level. Instead the talent would remain inhibited and waste away until death. As the result of their exposure to conditions that were beyond their control, they can be hindered and rendered unable to realize their talent - Which otherwise would've allowed them to achieve success, had they received the right information, the right resources or the right support

The default conditions of the natural world & the structures of the social world can turn out to can be contradictory to  and  philosophies. Just like how the horrible conditions of natural life will come into direct conflict with the  --- An oppressive and nepotist structure painted as neutral / impartial, will come into direct conflict with the 

To finish off, a quote from Tesla on success in the environment where it depends on validation and support from other people: ""The practical success of an idea, irrespective of its inherent merit, is dependent on the attitude of the contemporaries. If timely it is quickly adopted; if not, it is apt to fare like a sprout lured out of the ground by warm sunshine, only to be injured and retarded in its growth by the succeeding frost."" ~ Nikola Tesla"

Malcolm Gladwell: ""In the U.S. population, about 14.5 percent of all men are six feet or over. Among CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, that number is 58 percent. Even more strikingly, in the general American population, 3.9 percent of adult men are 6’2″ or taller. Among my CEO sample, 30 percent were 6’2″ or taller. Of the tens of millions of American men below 5’6″, a grand total of ten–in my sample–have reached the level of CEO, which says that being short is probably as much, or more, of a handicap to corporate success as being a woman or an African-American. That means that a person who is six feet tall but otherwise identical to someone who is five foot five will make on average $5,525 more per year. As Timothy Judge, one of the authors of the height-salary study, points out: “If you take this over the course of a 30-year career and compound it, we’re talking about a tall person enjoying literally hundreds of thousands of dollars of earnings advantage.” Have you ever wondered why so many mediocre people find their way into positions of authority in companies and organizations? It’s because when it comes to even the most important positions, our selection decisions are a good deal less rational than we think. We see a tall person and we swoon.""
""During one of the Republican presidential debates before the 2016 election, the web search company Google tracked what terms Internet users were searching for while watching on TV. The results were surprising. The top search wasn't ISIS. It wasn't Barack Obama's last day. It wasn't tax plans. It was: How tall is Jeb Bush? The search analytics unearthed a curious fascination among the voting public: Americans, it turns out, are fascinated with how tall the presidential candidates are. And they tend to vote for the tallest candidates, according to historic election results and research into voter behavior.""

The Life and Times of itsOVER (Legendary white incel slaying in Thailand),Untagged,Limerencel,"Jul 10, 2018",101000,451,"Even though @itsOVER is banned from this forum, his legacy lives on as he keeps feeding us wise words on Discord.
First, you have to know that he is a 5'7 white manlet NEET who was unable to get laid in his 23 years of living in the UK.





Just as he was getting ready to rope, he decided to try his luck in Thailand first.
Everything changed quickly, and now he has 1 child, and 2 other foids are pregnant by him.
His routine is simple: Date a young Thai foid, impregnate her, stay with her for 6 months, then leave. Why 6 months you ask?





How does he get money to afford living in Thailand as a NEET? He uses the generous studyloan-bux from the British government. He has no plans to ever pay it back, because




itsOVER rightfully believes everything except for sex and reproduction is cope.





You have an ugly face, and cope by begging the Almighty Lord for a foid who will love you despite of it?





You're thinking of running social circle game?




You want to compensate with a high salary?




Spending a lot of time crafting that perfect Tinder bio, buddy boyo?





However, even itsOVER has his weakness, and his secret cope comes from the cocoa tree.




In conclusion, the whitecels here should know that they have many options, that they have yet to excercise.
There are tons of foids in SEA that want to have sex with you, merely for being white.
Stop coping, and start taking action."
Virgin women significantly less likely to be sexual assault victims,JFL,Edmund_Kemper,"Aug 22, 2021",21000,98,"https://moscow.sci-hub.se/1094/c4a623549ef3cd30b3f47c84b61782b6/russell2001.pdf



In a 2001 study of 285 college women at a Midwestern private university (mean age is 21), they found that virgin women were significantly less likely to be sexually victimized.

Only 20.8% of virgin women are sexually victimized in their lifetime (79.2% were not). 57% of non-virgin women have been sexually victimized and 43% have not. 80.8% of sexually coercive women (yea women sexually assault men it happens) were sexually victimized too but 19.2% were not. Virgin women were less feminine and more masculine. Sexually coercive women were more feminine and less masculine.

Your standards are too high, and I don't mean for choosing women, I mean for what you expect from life, you have to adapt, we weren't born in the 50's, we were born in the era of whores (in my 20's), I've never felt love, only lust, never really wanted to get married all that much, only thought about it because parents try to poke that shit into their childrens heads over the years. I've started to realize that I'm not suffering as much as many of the incels on this site because I had the best ""default mindset"" for someone who would grow to be incel.

I only want sex, I don't want to feel desired, or admired, etc, I abandoned my ego years ago, I just want to enjoy the physical feeling that comes when you ejaculate into a womans body, and for that there's escorts, if I had your financial means I likely would have never even found this site because I'd be too busy, watching anime, playing games and fucking whores happily to care. Glad I found the site though.

Change your standards, not for women, but for life, latching onto normie standards when you clearly aren't one is illogical, the moment you focus on what you can enjoy in this life rather than what you can't enjoy you'll stop wasting time and feel a lot better. Also you are only getting to see the surface level of all the ""happy family"" BS that your friends ALLOW YOU TO SEE, most everything normies do is all about appearances, you see the smiling faces in images of vacations and family trips, you don't see the arguments your friend has with his wife about how little sex they have these days, that he suspects she's cheating, that he's worried about his son possibly being gay, that he thinks his daughter is no longer a virgin, the arguments that comes with the financial stress of having a family (mortgage, vehicles, tuition, school supplies, etc). You don't see all that shit, because they don't want you to, they only let you see ""the good shit"".

Most of the happiness normies get from the things you THINK you are missing out on IS SHORT LIVED, that's the great irony, we didn't really lose out on anything (inb4 this is cope), the only parts we legit missed out on were the PHYSICAL PARTS, the parts they enjoyed in their youth, most of which was an illusion anyways that they could only enjoy in blissful ignorance. Love isn't even a real thing, its just a chemical reaction in the brain, they weren't ""teens in love"", they were ""teens in lust"", but we only get to see those relationships from the outside looking in, so it looks so ""magical"" and ""grand"", again you didn't hear about all the bad shit, you never do, because normies don't like airing out their dirty laundry for others to see.

I have a friend that was going to be a doctor, complete normie coper, had ""inspirational quotes"" and shit on his book covers, studied hard, way smarter than me, would have definitely became a doctor, got all the necessary qualifications to pursue his university degree. The girl he was with for years cheated on him and he rebounded quick, he wasn't careful and a few months after he got his rebound pregnant when he was trying to get into university, guess who had to drop out and become a cuck, that's right him, in a lot of his images all I can see now is depression, he tries to hide it but he can't hide it well, met him in person at a store once too, he's now TRAPPED IN HIS OWN LIFE. Is sex enjoyable yes, and that's the only part of relationships that were really missing out on (unless you are some kind of idiot egoist that just wants to have their ego stroked, if so fuck off, this post is not for you, you will never be satisfied). Guess what, how much time for sex do you think people have when they have a child to worry about....... are you getting the point yet, the path that all normies take IRONICALLY LEADS THEM TO BE JUST AS UNHAPPY AS WE ARE.

I don't understand how you guys are so blind, WE ARE LIVING THE INVERSE LIVES OF NORIMES (Can't you see it?)

Normies start off having amazing lives, thrilling ""emotions"", great sex lives, having fun, but part of being a normie is ""settling down"", they are all followers because part of normie life is ""fitting in"", so they all mostly follow that road. As they reach the ""settling down"" phase their lives slowly become like ours, especially more so for the men, their sex lives dry up, they stop feeling less for the person they ""love"" and get hit with the black pill that even feelings fade over time because the human brain is wired to grow accustomed too and ""bored"" of similar stimuli.

Can you fap to the same porn video, every single day for for a month and REALLY get off to it, no, by the second week it won't be as enjoyable, now imagine the reality of this, but applied to a person OVER YEARS. That's the first black pill normies are forced to accept in their later years, you not only get bored of a person over time, but you get bored of ""loving them"" and eventually want someone else. Your brain is wired to do this, its part of our biological imperatives, monogamy is a forced thing, it isn't even normal for most other animals.

We however are somewhat cursed with how our lives began, but IT IS A BLESSING IN DISGUISE. We got black pilled early on all the shit that normies will end up learning ONLY WHEN ITS TOO LATE, we don't have to end up ""trapped in our own lives"". Don't get married, dont have children, just spend your years having sex with random beautiful women and enjoying your hobbies (whether you're paying for it (escorts), or looks/wealth maxxing to coerce women into fucking you). We've only failed at life here if we fail to take advantage of the benefits that come with having been incel, and that benefit is KNOWLEDGE.

Why do you guys think a mid life crisis is a ""normal"" and culturally known thing for men?, its because many men only start considering the shit we already thought of years ago, in their old age, when its too late to make changes because you have commitments to fulfill. So they perform copes like ""buying a nice car"" or ""dressing differently"", or the most outright admission of what I talked about above in relation to sex - THEY HAVE AN AFFAIR. They realize too late in life that one woman isn't enough.

I could never admire normies, not at this point, I already know how most of my other friends lives are going to end up, most of them are gonna be beta providers for some used up whore, have a few kids that will be hard to raise in this shitty era (kids might not even be theirs), probably get cheated on years into the marriage and maybe never find out because ""tee hee, its for the best, I don't want to hurt you, I love you"". Normiedom is the biggest long con, we ironically got screwed out of making a shitty deal, but again, we can only make this into a positive with effort and applying the black pill mindset practically. If you just LDAR, be a neet, don't work and build your wealth, then you're just going to remain a poor sex starved suidical poor sap, but if you do the opposite you'll actually look back on the days laughing at when you envied normies.

This isn't cope, this is reality, and I know I can't be the only person who has come to this realization, I have to work and talk to normies everyday so I have to learn to ""blend in"" and talk to them, every single damn relationship is terrible and the only glue that holds it all together IS SEX. Their lives are very ""fragile"". I know a guy right now (normie) who a month before was telling me about how great his GF is and how perfect she is and that they're getting married, last week he cheated on her with some random how who he ADMITS ISN'T AS ATTRACTIVE lol. He still plans on marrying her, do you see how much of a joke this BS fake illusion of the magical lives you think they're living is, stop fooling yourself, I could literally just message this girl and destroy his entire ""construct"" of ""normie life"" and let he know he cheated and who he did it with. But I won't because I don't care enough about his life to do it, I'm focusing on building my wealth, and fighting some normie right now isn't to my benefit, I just laugh and observe at these peoples lives, they project this air of happiness, especially online, but they are miserable, they are all LITERALLY COPING WITH THE JAIL CELL THAT IS THEIR ADULT LIFE (especially the ones with children, when you have kids ITS OVER)."
"Fact-checking a Redditor's cringeworthy ""message"" to Incels.is",Soy,PPEcel,"Aug 13, 2022",22000,97,"A particular post on Reddit has been making the rounds. It makes several explosive claims. Of course it does. It was designed to catch your attention.

Unsurprisingly, this Reddit post is filled to the brim with a mix of half-truths and outright lies. We know that this Redditor is full of shit because in liberal democracies—such as the United States and the United Kingdom—freedom of speech and of the press permits public access to a wide variety of judicial records, such as arrest warrant affidavits, investigative reports, grand jury indictments, plea agreements, and sentencing memorandums. As you will see, many claims this Redditor makes are either exaggerations or are so demonstrably false as to be disconnected from reality.

Let's start with the supposed list of dangerous incels.

Claim 1: ""David Kaufman - Arrested in NY for stalking a minor April 2020""



Reality: Kaufman was indeed arrested, convicted, and sentenced on federal cyberstalking charges. But Kaufman's arrest occurred in September, not April; and Kaufman certainly never victimized a minor. In fact, Kaufman's primary victims were a couple he met whilst attending college back in 2012—they were certainly not minors when the crime occurred in 2020.

See para. 9a on p.6 of the criminal complaint filed September 3rd, 2020:


Spoiler: Kaufman Affidavit




View: https://imgur.com/a/t5E6jXW



A third victim spoke at Kaufman's sentencing hearing, though under the terms of Kaufman's plea agreement, he was never convicted of victimizing her. According to the transcript (see below, p. 10-12), Alyssa Cascone was completing graduate school at the time the crime occurred. She was most definitely not a minor.


Spoiler: Transcript of Kaufman Sentencing



RECAP storage link



Kaufman was ultimately sentenced to 30 months imprisonment; according to information from the Federal Bureau of Prisons, he will be released from FCI Elkton in October 2022. Had he victimized a minor, his sentence would have been far more severe than a 2.5-year stint in a low-security camp.

Claim 2: ""Tres Genco - Arrested for planning to shoot up a sorority (inspired by Rogers) but was flagged due to posting about it on .IS and arrested in Ohio July 2021""



Reality: Genco, of Hillsboro, Ohio, was never allegedly ""flagged"" for posting on Incels.is about committing a mass shooting. The actual truth is much more embarrassing for Genco: he lived with his own mother, and she called the cops on him after they had a very heated argument, and county sheriffs allegedly found evidence that he was planning a mass shooting.

The Incels.is Moderation Team is, in fact, very familiar with the Genco case. In fact, one Incels.is moderator wrote a letter to the presiding judge asking that two documents, the search warrant affidavit and the ATF firearms report, be unsealed and available to the public.


Spoiler: Incels' Letter to Judge Susan J. Dlott

Both documents were later unsealed. The search warrant affidavit, amongst numerous other documents related to Genco's pretrial motions, affirms that Genco was reported to police by his own mother (and not by anonymous Redditors trying to find karma-farming material on Incels.is).

Claim 3: ""Johnny Young - Has a warrant out for his arrest after harassing woman in Nevada and California. August 2022""



Reality: There is no evidence proving that Young was a self-described incel or was otherwise connected to any incel community.

Claim 4: ""Malik Sanchez - Was arrested to giving a bomb threat. A bomb was found in his home. NY November 2021""



Reality: Sanchez was indeed arrested for a bomb threat—more of a live-streamed, stupid prank, really. A May 5th, 2021 letter from Assistant U.S. Attorney Kaylan Lasky opposing Sanchez's request for bail stated that all law enforcement found at Sanchez's home were:



""five magazines that fit a Glock firearm; an air soft gun; small rubber balls, possibly for the air soft gun; a paintball gun; paintball pellets; three canisters of pepper spray; a “practice only” spray canister; two pocket knives"". (p.7)

View: https://imgur.com/a/hdJ2gxY



No bomb was ever found at his home. Indeed, a female federal judge ordered Sanchez's release after he had spent just two weeks in jail, over the objections of AUSA Lasky. Sanchez ultimately received a no-jail sentence from Judge Colleen McMahon, much to the chagrin of soys and feminists. If an actual bomb was found in his home, he would most likely be serving a 30-year sentence in a high-security federal prison.

Instead, Sanchez is currently walking free on the streets of New York City:

Claim 5: ""Jake Davison (Plymouth Shooter)- Was arrested for killing 5 people in a mass shooting. He had an account on .IS. UK August 2021.""



Reality: Davison did not have an account on Incels.is. Moreover, senior counter-terrorism policing officials in the United Kingdom concluded that the Plymouth shooting was not an act of ""incel terrorism"".

Claim 6: Alek Minassion (Toronto Van Attack) - Arrested for hitting and killing 10 woman with his van during a protest. He had an account on .IS. Canada March 2021



Reality: Minassian did not have an account on Incels.is. Moreover, the presiding judge, Judge Anne Molloy of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, concluded that Minassian was not motivated by inceldom at all. Instead, she concluded that Minassian was merely a fame-seeker.

See para. 193 on p.51 of Molloy's judgement:



Nevertheless, I am inclined to accept the assessment of all of the experts that Mr. Doe did lie to the police about much of the incel motivation he talked about and that the incel movement was not in fact a primary driving force behind the attack.

Why did he do it? There is a long answer. There were multiple factors at play as I have described above, as well as the impact of his ASD, and possibly desensitization as a result of the depraved internet sites he frequented. But there is also a short answer, a bottom line: he did it to become famous.

Spoiler: R v. Minassian Reasons for Judgment



Reasons for Judgment



Claim 7: Robert Aaron Long - Shot up a spa with the reason they are to sexual for woman to enjoy (the same logic why many of you think woman should not ride bikes). He was a .IS user. Georgia March 2021

Reality: Long did not have an account on Incels.is. There is no evidence proving that Long was a self-described incel or was otherwise connected to any incel community.

Claim 8: Scott Beierle - Shooting Florida November 2018.



Reality: Beierle indeed committed a mass shooting in Florida in November 2018. Although his motives were described as misogynistic, there is no evidence proving that Beierle was a self-described incel or was otherwise connected to any incel community.

Claim 9: Armando Hernandez - Arrested for shooting a couple outside a mall. His reasoning for it was he was sick of seeing couples. Was an .IS user. Arizona May 2020

Reality: Hernandez did not have an account on Incels.is.

Claim 10: Alexander Stanropoulous - Arrested or plotting and attempted Murder of a woman. He told prosecutors he was an Incel. Canada January 2020

Reality: Aside from the misspelling of the defendant's name, this is the only claim that is factually correct in its entirety. I should note, however, that Canadian prosecutors did not classify this as a terrorist act. Stavropoulos, convicted of two counts of attempted murder for stabbing a woman and her baby, will be eligible for parole in just seven years.

Claim 11: Coty Scott Taylor - Kidnapped, (2R@p3d&, then murdered a 6 year old girl. He kept her dead body for two days after killing her. He said one of his reasons was that he was an incel and wanted someone who was not already “used”. South Carolina February 2020.



Reality: There is no evidence that Taylor raped Faye Swetlik before murdering her. Nor did Taylor ""say"" that his motive was ""inceldom"" and ""wanted someone who was not already used"". Indeed, Taylor committed suicide after the murder and could not be interrogated because he was dead. Nor did South Carolina police find evidence that Taylor was involved in any incel community. The only ""incel"" connection to Taylor comes from a police interview where Taylor's former roommate says Taylor claimed to be ""asexual"" and an ""incel""; a logical improbability. It is far more likely that Taylor was suffering from psychosis or another untreated mental illness.

Claim 12: Brandon Andrew Clark- Killed a woman. Arrested for planned homicide. He was a user of looksmax and .IS



Clark was a simp whose advances were spurned by ""e-girl"" Bianca Devins. He did not have an account on either Looksmax or .Is. Nor was Clark a self-proclaimed incel or connected to any incel community. Instead, his online activity revolved almost entirely around Discord, where he and other bluepilled simps lavished Devins with their time and attention.

Fun facts: The headlines are currently focused on the Oneida County District Attorney's Office, which is now being sued for leaking 17-year-old Devins' nudes to the media. Also, I also happen to have an image of her semi-decapitated corpse. Here you go:


Spoiler: NSFW







As you can see, Redditors play so fast and loose with the truth that just one out of these twelve sentences were correct. That's an accuracy rate of roughly 8.3%. Not good.

There are also some remaining claims in this Reddit post, all of which are also false. For example, there is the suggestion that the U.S. Secret Service reported in March 2022 that ""incels as a demographic are the most likely to commit domestic terrorism"". In reality, the words ""terror"", ""terrorist"", or ""terrorism"" don't appear once in the 10,230-word report, for good reason: U.S. law enforcement doesn't consider inceldom to be terrorism at all, because inceldom is neither explicitly political nor religious. You can read the U.S. Secret Service report for yourself here.

In 2022 so far, more femoids have been killed by garbage trucks than in incel shootings; I dare say that federal law enforcement are more interested in left-wing activists seeking to harm U.S. Supreme Court Justices than they are in lonely virgins venting on the internet.

Then there is the suggestion that the Incels.is mods ""work"" with people like ""them"" and regularly ""report"" to the FBI, MI5, and CSIS. That simply could not be further from the truth. For over eight months now, it has been the Moderation Team's policy not to conceal, but to highlight and discuss court cases involving incels, alleged incels, and more. We have always encouraged incels to broaden their understanding of the complex legal apparatus that governs their speech and every aspect of their daily lives. Would any ""honeypot"" encourage discussion of the law and suppress illegal speech? No, it would not.

And what do these Redditors think they're doing? Do they really think that the FBI relies on a group of mentally ill pink-haired 300-pound trannys to go about its daily business? That the Moderation Team ""works"" with Redditors? They are suffering from delusions of grandeur. The FBI failed to prevent Parkland, Buffalo, Uvalde, et cetera; and it's unlikely that these landwhale amateurs could've done any better. Here's the brutal truth: over the next year, there will be dozens more mass killings in schools and supermarkets and places of worship, and there is nothing that a bunch of randos sitting at home can do about it. Violent extremism, not unlike car crashes and house fires, is simply a fact of life in our societies. Suck it up and take out a life insurance policy.

Conclusion

In posting their factually baseless screed, this Redditor has two core aims. First, they seek to foster division within our site. This is a pretty lame attempt to deter new users from joining us and to prompt some gullible greycels to leave. We remain undeterred. By every metric, incel communities, including Incels.is, have steadily grown over the years.

Second, Redditors have already failed. This is, well, copium. If soys weren't desperate, they'd speak using cold, hard facts, not a mix of half-truths and emotion. They seek to deplatform us, but we have survived. Later this year, Incels.is will be celebrating our 5th birthday. Every single month, at least one Redditor claims that the FBI or some other law enforcement agency is on the very verge of seizing our website and arresting the leadership for good. Of course, it hasn't happened—they've cried wolf one too many times—because incels are entitled to the same constitutional rights everyone else is. We've had our share of ups and downs, no doubt; but we're still here, a middle finger to the progressive orthodoxy.

So Redditors, delusional and narcissistic as always, are settling on a new narrative. Moving the goalposts. It's a convenient lie they can feed themselves so they can create a sense of purpose out of their miserable lives: ""I'm a barista by day, but at night I'm a super elite secret agent who hunts these big, bad inkwells on the interwebs by screenshotting their posts!"" It's self-comforting, of course; after all, many of them have spent hundreds if not thousands of hours obsessively poring over our posts.

Everyone's entitled to their freedom of speech, of course; but no one is entitled to their own set of facts. They can whine and squeal and stomp their feet all they want, but the blackpill as an idea will continue to survive. We'll stick around to joke about the very next mass killings and celebrate the next time that the legal system delivers soys and femoids an L. We promise."

In fact, in the animal world, the whole concept of validation is non-existant. Validation is a social construct, it is a figment of imagination and only exists in the minds of humans.

2. Men of the past didn't care about validation

If validation is inherent to human nature, then men of the past should also have chased after validation, seeing as though nature is a constant throughout the time-space continuum. But this is not the case, as evidenced by the prevalence of arranged marriages, which took place in order to establish a union/alliance between 2 clans/houses. Marriage was an institution which was established with the purpose of cementing a relationship between 2 families by merging their bloodlines, enabling unquestionable loyalty of the families to each other. The men of the past were aware of this fact, thus they didnt care what the women whom they were marrying thought of them, they cared more about forming powerful unions/alliances which would elevate their respective families/houses to a position of strength.

The only reason men of the present chase after illusory concepts such as ""love"" and ""female validation"" is because they have been indoctrinated and brainwashed to do so via feminist propaganda masquerading in the form of the education system and media. Feminism is a movement with the objective of establishing female superiority, disguised as a movement for equality. The ultimate goal of feminists is to make men subservient to women, what better way to do this then by influencing men to value female validation, implicitly influencing men to value females themselves, creating a generation of men who are essentially pussy beggars and female worshippers.

The difference between the men of the past (who didnt care about validation at all) and the men of the present (who seek female validation) is socialization.

YOUR DESIRE FOR SEX IS BIOLOGICAL, YOUR DESIRE FOR VALIDATION IS DUE TO SOCIALIZATION

3. Valuing Female validation whilst devaluing females themselves is contradictory.

@BlkPillPres pretty much sums it up perfectly:



BlkPillPres said:



FEMALE VALIDATION:
A lot of incels hold on to multiple concepts that contradict eachother.

They believe things about women related to evolution psychology that devalue their existence (they are genetically hardwired to be hypergamous, inherently selfish, etc), while at the same time they value their validation and what they think of them, those are two contradictory concepts, if women are as bad as the black pill tells us, and we truly believe it, then there is no reason to value anything they think.

I've been saying this for a while, nobody really wants female validation, we've just been indoctrinated over years as children and basically socialized to value and chase after it, that's because female validation is the prerequisite to what we really want, sex. Well its the prerequisite to attaining sex the ""usual way"" (courtship), you can just pay for it.

Its completely contradictory to both acknowledge that women are basically instinct driven and illogical, and yet somehow value whether or not they admire you or think highly of you. They are basically like an AI running lines of code, would you care if an AI, something that has no true concept of reality and merely does what its ""code"" dictates, cares about you? (I doubt it).

Of what value is its evaluation of you, when it has no true sense of self. How can you devalue women as an existence, while at the same time claiming that their evaluation of you is something that matters (do you see the obvious contradiction yet?).

That would be like me saying I have a broken mirror, yet I trust its ability to give me an accurate reflection. One should only value the evaluation given by someone relative to how much they value the logical integrity of said person, in other words, if you truly believe everything the black pill says, then by valuing female validation, aren't you putting stake in the competency of a group of individuals, you yourself deem as incompetent?

Female validation is just the usual prerequisite to attaining sex, it is not the goal it is the prerequisite to achieving the goal, and only a foolish egoist chases after validation, as black pillers were supposed to be introspective, the ""deep thinkers"", to cling and chase after female validation is illogical, especially for an incel, you already know what it is you really want, sex, so chase after that, and when you simply see things in such a manner a whole slew of options open up to you, things you did not even consider because your ego was blinding you from it.

Click to expand...


I tried to explain this shit to some retards in the Incel Discord server, namely @Lester and even a mod @knajjd who said that desire for validation is biological, but without even listening to my arguments they verbally attacked me, calling me stupid and low IQ (lol, the irony) and kicked me from the server.

We've reached a point where this forum has become inundated by users who think they're blackpilled (when they really aren't), and to top it all off they have turnip level IQ.

This isnt even a surprise at this point considering the fact that AT LEAST ONE OF THE MODS aren't blackpilled. I felt initially frustrated that there are people who are so low IQ that they dont have the IQ to comprehend the fact that they're low IQ , but later i just felt sorry for them, life must be really tough when you are THAT mentally challenged"

PART 1: LOOKS ARE OBJECTIVE

All scientific evidence supports a universal criterion for attractiveness


""These cross-cultural and infant studies support the notion of the
universality of beauty with some standards set by nature and not our social heritage.
Rather than being the outcome of slow acculturation, beauty preferences seem to be
a result of a basic cognitive process that appears quite early in life [12].""

""In fact, agreement between individuals
is one of the most robust findings in facial attractiveness research since the 1970s,
suggesting that people everywhere are using similar criteria in their judgments [13].""

-Taken from chapter 2 of ""Beauty and body dysmorphic disorder"" by Neelam A. Vashi.

""While individual and cross-cultural differences exist (see later), this politically correct view of beauty is to some extent false. In fact, agreement between individuals is one of the best-documented and most robust findings in facial attractiveness research since the 1970s. Across many studies it has been found that there is a high degree of agreement from individuals within a particular culture and also high agreement between individuals from different cultures (see [2] for a meta-analytical review). If different people can agree on which faces are attractive and which are not attractive when judging faces of varying ethnic background (e.g. [23]), then this suggests that people everywhere are all using the same, or at least similar, criteria in their judgements.""

- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3130383/

""Generally, physical attractiveness can be viewed from a number of perspectives; with universal perceptions being common to all human cultures, cultural and social aspects, and individual subjective preferences. The perception of attractiveness can have a significant effect on how people are judged in terms of employment or social opportunities, friendship, sexual behavior, and marriage.[17]""

What is ""Evolutionary Psychology""?

""Evolutionary psychology attempts to provide ultimate as well as proximate explanations of human behaviour. Proximate mechanisms are those that directly cause a particular behaviour (for instance we have sex because we enjoy it) whereas ultimate explanations are cast at the level of design by natural selection (we have sex because it leads to offspring).""
(Workman & Reader, 2014, p. 27)

""[Evolutionary psychology is] the principles of Darwinian natural selection [applied] to the study of the human mind. A central claim is that the brain (and therefore the mind) evolved to solve problems encountered by our hunter-gatherer ancestors during the upper Pleistocene period over 10,000 years ago, a time known as the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptation (EEA). The mind, therefore, is seen as equipped with species-specific ‘instincts’ that enabled our ancestors to survive and reproduce and which give rise to a universal human nature.""
(Workman & Reader, 2014, p. 1)

TLDR: How is evolutionary psychology directly relevant to the blackpill?

Evolutionary psychology explains why we are predisposed, or programmed, in certain ways. These underlying factors could be seen as major contributors to the existence of incels. Many of the theories of evolutionary psychology which relied heavily on self-reported and observational information are now being supported by data gathered from dating services such as OkCupid and Tinder.

""Hence if natural selection is survival of the fittest then we can think of sexual selection as ‘survival of the sexiest’.""
(Workman & Reader, 2014, p. 59)



Fundamental Theories and Explanations
Proposed Reasons for How We Date and Mate


Spoiler: Part 2



Basic tenets of mating from the evolutionary psychology perspective:

""Intrasexual selection consists of individuals competing with members of their own sex for access to the opposite sex. In most cases this means males fighting with each other for access to females. In contrast, intersexual selection consists of members of one sex attempting to impress members of the other; in this case the emphasis is on females since they are generally the ones that need to be impressed before they will assent to mating. This means that for most species we can equate intrasexual selection with male/male competition and intersexual selection with female choice.""
(Workman & Reader, 2014, p. 59)

Why are females the selectors and men the ones competing for selection?

""In 1972 Robert Trivers suggested that sexual selection is directly related to asymmetries between the sexes in the amount of effort that each parent puts into raising the offspring. He called this effort parental investment.""
(Workman & Reader, 2014, p. 60)

Parental investment refers to the fact that women have to not only generate eggs, which are less numerous and less readily available than sperm, but also carry a baby to term while also devoting a certain amount of the nutrients the woman consumes to maintain the fetus. When the baby is born, they have a useless infant to raise, protect, feed, clean, and generally care for.

Men, on the other hand, can impregnate many women in a single day and never invest anything more than their sperm. As such, women have to be more selective of their mates, because it presents a greater potential cost to them. From this arises male competition for selection.

What is an example of this?

Approximately 2 million years ago, our ancestors began to consume calorie-rich meat. This change in diet promoted a change in how we get our food (hunting), how we invest our time (because meat presents a greater density of calories per successful hunt than foraging does, it gives us more free time for advancement), required that we advance our social abilities and structures, and affected mate selection. Here's an example as to how; it is called the provisioning hypothesis.
(Cosmides & Tooby, 1997, p. 91)

""Perhaps by forming a long-term sexual relationship with a good hunter, a woman and her offspring would benefit from the food provided in return.""
(Workman & Reader, 2014, pp. 86-88)

This explains why men, for whom it would normally make the most sense to simply impregnate as many women as possible, began to invest more heavily in the success of one pregnancy. However, at a biological level, they are still equipped to reproduce with multiple women, and still possess the impetus to do so when they are not committed to the success of one pregnancy.

A biological artifact of the times predating this transition to a meat-eating, long-term relationship arrangement that heavily indicates that this transition happened at all is the presence of ""kamikaze sperm,"" (Dixson, 2009, p. 170). The majority of sperm that a man ejaculates during copulation is actually incapable of producing a zygote when in contact with a female egg. Its sole purpose is to eliminate the sperm of other men; this is referenced in the title and content of the book ""Sperm Wars"" (2006) by Robin Baker, which has been repeatedly suggested by @nausea on the forums. As society progressed to a more monogamous standard for relationships, this evolutionary trait became functionally obsolete outside of fringe cases and/or infidelity. However, it has never left us because there was no evolutionary imperative for it to do so, and its effects continue to create interesting situations which will be explored briefly later.



Studies and Observations in Academia
Research into the Asymmetries


Spoiler: Part 3



How does parental investment, the provisional hypothesis, and female selection manifest today?

Women rate the following things as being important with greater emphasis than their male counterparts:

Dependability
Education/Intelligence
Ambition/Industriousness
Financial Prospects

Women generally seek older partners; hypothesized to be because they are more likely to be in possession of the above attributes.

(Note that all of these things are direct parallels to the provisional hypothesis)

(Buss, 2016, p. 110; Workman & Reader, 2014, p. 89)

Men rate the following things as being important with greater emphasis than their female counterparts:

Attractiveness (Hip-Waist Ratio being a major contributor, as well as others)
Age (Youth)

(Note that all of these things are indicators of a woman's fertility and potential for bearing children)

(Buss, 2016, p. 142; Workman & Reader, 2014, p. 89)

How does infidelity in women support these theories and self-reported preferences?

""By taking a secret lover who is physically superior to, or of higher status than, her husband, a woman can potentially improve the status of the male offspring she produces. In support of this, Baker and Bellis (1993) have found that, when a married woman has an affair, her lover is almost invariably of higher status than her husband. Some evolutionists have even suggested that when women cuckold their partners they do so with more attractive men than their husbands (Simpson, Gangestad and Bick, 1993; Wright, 1994). This may be of benefit if such women pass on these attractive features to their sons who would then have improved chances of attracting women. For obvious reasons this notion has become known as the sexy sons hypothesis (Fisher, 1958; Gangestad and Simpson, 1990).""
(Workman & Reader, 2014, p. 104)

Why are some women more selective than others, and why are the most desirable women out of reach for certain men?

""Her perceived level of attractiveness to males. Some evolutionists have proposed that, as a girl grows up, the feedback she receives from males provides her with a self-knowledge of her level of attractiveness – her ‘market value’ (Trivers, 1972). This self-knowledge, Robert Trivers speculates, may then affect her reproductive strategy. Females who perceive themselves as less attractive might be more likely to engage in casual sexual relationships since they are less likely to gain a long-term high-quality partner (Harris, 1998). For those who receive feedback suggesting that they are particularly attractive, however, it may make more sense to hold out for a high-status male from which they are likely to gain a high level of investment (Trivers, 1972; Wright, 1994). This is a controversial notion but one for which there is some empirical support. Walsh (1993) has found that the less attractive a woman feels she is, the more partners she is likely to have. Moreover there is clear evidence that the most beautiful women in a given society do tend to marry the most powerful men (Symons, 1979).""
(Workman & Reader, 2014, p. 106)

Tell me more.

""When males vary substantially in status (based on skill, resources, power, etc.), women prefer higher status males as long-term pair-bonded partners, though they may also seek ‘good genes’ via extra-pair copulations when pair-bonded to a low-quality male.""
(Henrich, Boyd, & Richerson, 2012, p. 657)

What are the male short-term dating strategies in this kind of sexual landscape?

In general, men pursue numbers and variety in their approach to modern dating. This results in many men lowering their standards in order to achieve success. What they are doing is maximizing their returns on investment, with one of the driving forces being a search for women with high sexual acessibility.

“Time, energy, and courtship resources devoted to women who are unlikely to consent to sex would interfere with the successful pursuit of short-term mating.”
(Buss, 2016, p. 174)



Evidence from Modern Dating Sites and Apps
This is where the Blackpills really are.


Spoiler: Part 4






Spoiler: 4.1: It's over for ugly men



This may come as no surprise, but the odds for an ugly man are truly slim due to a multitude of factors.

4.1a: 35% of men swipe on every woman


Spoiler: 4.1a



""All men using Tinder (and other similar dating services) to which I ever talked to, were complaining about low match rate. So after a while some of them start to swipe right as much as possible to first get matches with women that liked them, and then think whether it’s worth writing to them. This is exactly the strategy which was proven by authors of the paper as well with 35% of males using this strategy frequently. Female users on the contrary stay very picky in swiping right as they receive a lot of matches.""





(Ortega & Hergovich, 2017)

Let us make the assumption that this 35% of men is the bottom 35% in terms of looks. While this isn't true at all, we can use this as a foundation to explain why this means that ugly men are fucked.

This means that if you are in the 25th percentile in terms of looks (75% of men are more attractive than you). Then you are still going to be less attractive than 10% of men who swipe right on every woman. Meaning, that on the off chance that there is a truly hideous, undesirable woman who is swiping right on every man, she will still run into a large number of men who have swiped right on her AND are more attractive than you. Obviously, the worse off you are in appearance, the more men there are who are more attractive than you and are swiping right on EVERY woman.

Don't forget the assumption we made earlier - that the 35% of men who swipe right on every woman is also the bottom 35%. The simple fact is that this is not the case. What this means is that even if you are at the 35th or 50th percentile of men by looks, there will still be men more attractive than you who are swiping right on every woman.

This supports the theory of intersexual competition between males, and the intrasexual selection done by females. This also support the sexual accessibility theory.




4.1b: Even if you get a match, you're probably too late


Spoiler: 4.1b



As the aforementioned theories suggest, men would be eager to jump on any prospect that opens up to them as soon as possible. This is confirmed through the research:

""63% of messages sent by men occur within 5 minutes of the match taking place. This is only 18% for women, suggesting that female users often wait to receive a message first. The median delay for sending messages is just 2 minutes for men, compared to 38 minutes for women. This could be driven by several factors, but it is well known that men often have to compete and differentiate themselves more as part of the mating ritual.""
(Ortega & Hergovich, 2017)

Let's say it's a Friday night at 9 PM. Hormones are heavy in the air on the streets of your local downtown area, and it is the prime time for match-making on services like Tinder.

By some miracle, you as an ugly man have matched with a woman. However, because we know that so many men, some of which are more attractive than you, are right swiping everyone, chances are you're not the first to have matched with this woman. It's okay, there is still hope! If you send a message quickly, she will surely take notice of you, right?

Wrong. Your strategy is the same for the vast majority of men.

Every time you see a statistic attached to men, try the thought experiment we ran in 4.1a. Imagine that instead of it being just 63% of messages sent by men, but the messages sent by the bottom 63% of men. Even then, a 25th percentile man will be mogged by men up to 38 percentile points above him.

Now, what if by some stroke of luck, you're not too late? We're in the clear, right?

Wrong again. As we read above, women are consistently looking to upgrade their potential mate. As a result, if a more attractive man matches and messages the woman while she is conversing you, what's stopping her from ghosting you and talking to him instead? Nothing at all.

This is just a hypothetical situation without any data, so let's migrate back to more data-rich pastures in the next few sections.




4.1c: Women are the ones with unrealistic beauty standards


Spoiler: 4.1c



To preface this point, we need to keep in mind what are the mathematically proven standards for being attractive, ""medium,"" and ""significantly below medium"" according to the opposite sex:

Attractive




""Medium""




""Significantly below medium""



(Rudder, 2009 November)

Note: the staff at OkCupid didn't think it acceptable to present you with real profiles of men and women who were rated ""significantly below medium."" However, they were comfortable with sharing their own profiles, which were also rated ""significantly below medium."" In other words, the staff of OkCupid consists in part of unattractive men. I don't want to jump to any unsubstantiated conclusions, but it does seem to be a very interesting phenomenon.

It's bad enough that as an unattractive male you are objectively mogged by your competitors who are swiping right on everyone. Women also espouse standards of beauty that aren't just vaguely unrealistic, they are mathematically impossible.





""The two curves together suggest some strange possibilities for the female thought process, the most salient of which is that the average-looking woman has convinced herself that the vast majority of males aren’t good enough for her, but she then goes right out and messages them anyway.”
(Rudder, 2009 November)

This graph demonstrates that women place the top 80% of men as being below-average in looks. In other words, while you may objectively be at the 25th percentile in terms of looks, women will consistently underrate your appearance. Put even more simply, to a woman you are even uglier than you actually are.

“It’s women, not men, who have unrealistic standards for the “average” member of the opposite sex.”
(Rudder, 2009 November)

The second part of the quote by Rudder really drives home the asymmetry in the current dating market in terms of partner attitudes: women message men who she thinks are less attractive than her consistently, so is immediately approaching the situation as a disappointment or a step down from what she thinks she deserves.

This demonstrates that women are selective to the point of mathematical impossibility.

It is also worth noting the stark contrast between the female and male attractiveness rating distribution:




(Rudder, 2009 November)

As can be seen in the above graph, male assessment of female beauty in the market depicts a largely normal curve. implying an incredibly realistic and sensible rating scale. Simply put, 50% of women are above average, 50% of women are below average, and either extreme is much less represented than the middle (~average).

Their messaging habits are also highly sensible, in that ""2/3 of male messages go to the top 1/3 of women,"" as is stated in the article cited above. The majority of men are seeking to copulate with the most attractive available women in their area.

""A hot woman receives 4x the messages an average-looking woman gets, and 25x as many as an ugly one.""
(Rudder, 2011)

Let's run our thought experiment one more time. What this means for unattractive men who are also naturally inclined to find the top 1/3 of women attractive is that even if those 2/3 of men were all ""reachers"" in the sense that they are the bottom 66% in terms of looks, and are all looking to hook up with the top 33% of women in terms of looks, for the average 25th percentile man messaging a woman in the top 1/3, he is competing against men that are up to 40 percentile points more attractive than him.

Keep in mind, again, that this hypothetical situation is veritably false, and that the man at the 25th percentile is habitually getting mogged by men who are MORE than 40 percentile points more attractive than him whenever he messages a woman who is above the 66th percentile in terms of looks.




4.1d: Everyone, on average, is ""reaching up""


Spoiler: 4.1d



""When we looked specifically at sending the first message, we found one striking habit: everyone’s a reacher, meaning people tend to reach out to someone more attractive than they are. To put a number on it, men are reaching out to women 17 percentile points more attractive, and women contact men who are 10 percentile points more attractive. This means that if a woman does nothing, her inbox will be filled with less attractive men.“
(Cooper, 2015)

OkCupid and other dating services have an internal algorithm that measures a person's attractiveness; this is computed by an Elo-like system. While this is unfortunate for ugly men with high standards to begin with, it also means we can quantifiably explain why unattractive men get limited attention on the service.

We already know that 2/3rds of men message the top 1/3 of women, there it's not surprising that men are reaching out to women who are on average 17 percentile points more attractive. It's also perhaps unsurprising that women reach out to men who are 10 percentile points above them as well; after all, everyone wants to secure the best possible mate for themselves, and everyone is attracted to attractive people. However, keep in mind that this is an average of all women's messaging. Why is this important?

Well, for one thing, women who are at the 91st and above percentile physically CAN'T message men who are 10 points above them. That means that on average, the women who are at the 90th and above percentile must consistently bring down the average difference between a female sender and male recipient. The difference is therefore likely made up elsewhere - for example, women who are less attractive messaging men who are 30 or 40 points above them.

This explains why, as our hypothetical 25th percentile male, you may look at the quote above and think ""Oh! That means that at the very least, I'll get messages from women who are in the 15th percentile!"" Unfortunately that is not what this number means to you; those women are still likely to be looking for more attractive males than you (just as 2/3rds of men message the top 1/3rd of females).

Add on top of this the fact that as we learned in 4.1c, women have objectively faulty standards for beauty. This creates the following paradox: Women consistently message men they deem to be below themselves, yet consistently message men who are above themselves in terms of attractiveness. This means that when a woman is messaging a guy who is more attractive than her, she thinks she is downgrading. Meanwhile, as mentioned above, your messages to her rot in her inbox. If the average woman thinks that the average man men that is 10 points above her is beneath her standards, and she is on average 17 points more attactive than you if you sent that first message, then how do you think she feels about YOU? If you are our 25th percentile subject, that means that typically speaking, she is at the 42nd percentile (slightly below average, not exactly a steal), and the guy that she thinks is beneath her standards is in the 52nd percentile. Read that again - the guy who is decidedly average, and mathematically speaking twice as attractive, is viewed as a downgrade by your REACH option. There's only so many ways I can rephrase this and present it in different ways, so let me just get to the conclusion: it's over.

As I mentioned before, the 10 percentile points is an average and the 25th percentile subject is hypothetical. However, what do the real numbers say about the potential success rate of these people who are reaching for more attractive partners?




(Rudder, 2009 November)

While this is probably extremely intuitive for the members of this site, it needs to be said: while it is true that on average men reach for women more attractive than themselves, the success rate of these advances is heavily dependent on not only the man's absolute attractiveness but also his relative attractiveness to his target, as can be seen in the graph above. In other words, the chances for unattractive men to bat outside of their league is much lower than it is for every man who is more attractive than him.








Spoiler: 4.2: It's over for short men



The next few subtopics will focus on particular flaws that men have that affect their dating (and mating) chances in the modern era. They will not be as lengthy as the first, as being generally considered unattractive encompasses these elements to varying degrees in every individual, and they are also potentially harder to control for.

One of the reasons why it's hard to control for things like height, for example, is because users on OkCupid and Tinder lie about their height, a lot.




(Rudder, 2010)

Based on a data set of 1.51 million users, Christian Rudder of OkCupid was able to demonstrate that either OkCupid male users are taller, or they are lying. Furthermore, ""this means that... as they get closer to six feet [they] round up a bit more than usual, stretching for that coveted psychological benchmark,"" (2010).

Women are guilty of this too, but due to the nature of selectivity that we have discussed at length, I find it unsurprising that it is much easier to find examples of women taunting short men than it is to find the same interaction with the sexes switched. While the users on this board should be well aware of the many examples, I've included a few here just for posterity and in case someone not in the know is perusing this:



Spoiler: Suifuel for short men

















What some may write off as jokes, memes, or Twitter trolling, has a very real and observable effect on the dating market.




(Rudder, 2010)

Women consistently message men who are taller, with the trend peaking at just past 6'0'' and continuing until a dip at 6'8''. Clearly, height has an influence on the likelihood of getting initial interest from women. That's not all, however.




(Rudder, 2010)

While this data is clearly self-report, it is worth noting that even given the likely number inflation by certain dating site users, taller men end up with a greater number of sexual partners. Given the factual data about messages received by men vs. their height, we have three possible explanations for these numbers:

1. Taller men lie more about their sexual escapades, while also receiving a greater amount of positive female attention.
2. Shorter men lie more about their sexual escapades, while also receiving a lesser amount of positive female attention.

I think that it is clear which explanation is more logically consistent.





Spoiler: 4.3: It's over for ethnic men



There is a well-known sociological phenomenon known as ""in-group out-group bias."" Basically any unifying characteristic between multiple individuals can form the foundation of an ""in-group,"" such as incels on incels.is. People who do not possess those characteristics or possess opposing characteristics are seen as the ""out-group."" We are naturally inclined to find camaraderie with and act favorably towards those in our in-group, while acting with suspicion, derision, or animosity towards the out-group. This is so well-documented that I struggle to find a legitimate source, such as a textbook, that is readily available that has a basic overview of the subject, but here is the Wikipedia page for the phenomenon for your perusal:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups

Here is an article using the bias as a foundation for an argument about insularity breeding extremism (something that incel communities are accused of, as many of you well know):

https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/...n-groups-out-groups-and-the-psychology-crowds

""In-group"" and ""out-group"" can be succinctly phrased as ""us"" and ""them."" As Pink Floyd poetically said in the aptly-named ""Us and Them"":

Us, and them,
And after all, we're only ordinary men

Unfortunately, research in the fields of evolutionary psychology and sociology has demonstrated time and time again that we are not ALL simply ordinary men. Just as equality is a virtue that is praised but remains untenable due to the inherent inequalities of nature and the world at large, being ""ordinary men"" is a fate that not everyone shares. To further complicate matters, ""ordinary"" heavily depends on context; depending on where you are, certain qualities, characteristics, and behaviors are either acceptable or unacceptable, normal or abnormal. Standards for beauty, and thus potential for attraction, are no different.

As such, dating services in the West have produced enormous amounts of data supporting the in-group out-group bias, in the form of match statistics based on race x gender. Unsurprisingly, ethnic men on average struggle greatly in comparison with their Caucasian compatriots.

Some initial work done by Christian Rudder from OkCupid demonstrated that there are ""unexpected"" differences in response rates in reciprocal situations (when a white man messages a black woman vs. when a black woman messages a white man, for example):




(Rudder, 2009 October)

I believe the statistics here are relatively self-explanatory.

Using this as a justification for further research, Rudder has provided us with the following charts:




(Rudder, 2009 October)

What you see above are the response rates when a man of a certain race messages a woman of a certain race.

Some interesting things to note:

1. White men get more responses when matched with almost any race of woman than any other race, in some cases more than men who are of the same race as the women.
2. Everyone else does relatively poorly with everyone, with the exception of Pacific Islanders doing surprisingly well with some females.
3. Asian men are the only group of people to do as poorly as Indian men do with Indian women.
4. The only pairing that is even less fortuitous for the man (than Indian x Indian or Asian x Indian) is when he is black and the woman is Asian.

The major point here is this: that white men are almost always more likely to receive a response than their ethnic counterparts, regardless of the race of the recipient.

One thing that I excluded from the above list of interesting things to note is that black females seem to be the most receptive of all females. I left it out because of this chart:




(Rudder, 2009 October)

It is unlikely to be a coincidence that black females, the racial representatives most likely to respond to male messages, are the ones who are getting responded to the least. Meanwhile, white men, who receive the most responses from their targets, are also the ones that respond the least to others. It is clear that ethnic men struggle in a similar fashion to black women, as they don't have the luxury of being as selective as white men because they get less attention and fewer responses in the first place.

In 2014, when reviewing how the data has changed in the 5 years since the first series of analyses was run, he found that in the same time window in which Obama had been re-elected for a second term and progressive social movements were gaining traction, the changes to the race x gender dynamics of the sexual landscape had barely changed at all.
(Rudder, 2014, September 10)

This is hardly surprising given what we know about evolutionary psychology - that we are evolving much slower than the world around us. An apt analogy for this was put forward by Cosmides and Tooby, who have stated that in our ""modern skulls"" resides a ""stone-age brain,"" (1997, p. 90). Just as the other criteria for desirable mates have remained largely unchanged throughout the millennia, the in-group out-group bias that kept our ancestors from killing their clanmates over a minor crime and prevented them from approaching militant enemy tribes trustingly and unarmed, remains alive an well in our selection of partner based on race.





Spoiler: 4.4: It's over for poor men



As we learned in the first few sections of this post, women have been seeking males who can satisfy a providing role in their lives for at least 2 million years. The inventions of farming and barter, coinage, and the wage economy have happened, relatively speaking, so recently that it is astonishing that women in the West have already adapted their preferences to some degree from desiring a man who can hunt to a man who earns money. Perhaps this speaks to the universal and malleable nature of the provider role, and how it is not any absolute value or quality that satisfies it, but a value that is contextually important. While this is an interesting topic that could explain things like Thailand trips for ex-pats, this isn't the focus of this sub-topic. It's how poor men in the West fill the same role as a crippled man would have 2 million years ago, when his value and ability to provide was measured by his ability to hunt and protect his family.

The first indicator we have that wealth and income are objectively important metrics is that, much like height, an overwhelming amount of people lie about their income.





""Look at the graph to watch as people exaggerate more as they get older. As you can see, people advertise disproportionately high salaries for themselves. Just to pick a symbolic amount, there are consistently 4× the number of people making $100K a year than there should be.""
(Rudder, 2010)





""For each age we were very careful to adjust for OkCupid’s particular demographics: we compared every individual against the average not just by age but by zip code.""
(Rudder, 2010)

As can be seen in the above graph, men consistently exaggerate more than women do. Again, given what we know from the earlier sections, this is not unexpected.

However, does all this posturing and lying pay off? Does it serve a purpose besides covering for some insecurities?




(Rudder, 2010)

For men, you bet your ass it does. Christian Rudder drops a massive blackpill in this OkCupid article; so perfectly worded, I don't need to emphasize or rephrase anything:

""If you’re a young guy and don’t make much money, cool. If you’re 23 or older and don’t make much money, go die in a fire.""

What makes this phenomenon even worse is that it is habitually perpetuated by men themselves. As each individual man, in his own self-interest of maximizing his chances of copulating, lies about his income, projects an image of wealth that may not be representative of his true earnings, and strives to fit the provider role ideal, he over-inflates the expectations of women and the disparity between appearance and reality. In other words, while women are deceived into thinking that there are four times as many six-figure-salary men in the dating pool as there really are, she naturally thinks her chances of securing one are four times higher than they truly are, at any level of attractiveness. When her girlfriend hooks up with one of these men, there is a 75% chance that he was lying about his income to begin with, but how would she know that if she doesn't look at his bank statement? He will continue to accrue items that display the wealth he does not have, and spend lavishly in ways he cannot afford, until he either finally makes it to his promised income level or crumbles. Until that happens, our original woman, seeing her friend securing a man who on the surface seems to fit the provider role perfectly with his claimed six-figure-salary, will hold out until she can meet a man in a similar position, not knowing the whole time that she has a 75% chance of being bamboozled.

For poor men, they can't even pretend to run the fake wealth game, because if they do not have, do not buy, and do not do the things that richer men have, they will be much less likely to be believed. Not only do we have the data-driven evidence above of how a woman is unlikely to consider a poor man, we have anecdotal evidence of how a woman is unlikely to stay with a man that she claims to love if she perceives him as being poor as well:

Orginal TwoXChromosomes post, conveniently deleted by mods. One user asks ""What happened here?"" Another aptly responds, ""Just moderator in damage control mode. Sometimes, even special snowflakes melt."" As you will soon see, this is unsurprising given that this post unintentionally revealed the dark underbelly of the female provider-seeking nature, and the female mods felt threatened by such a revelation.

Thankfully, the ""Pussy Pass Denied"" sub took notice of this post and preserved it for our reading pleasure. You can also find the full text below:



Spoiler: Someone PLEASE help make sense of my ex-boyfriends actions.



Someone PLEASE help make sense of my ex-boyfriends actions. (self.TwoXChromosomes) submitted 7 hours ago by into-the-abyss TL;DR - My boyfriend kept his wealth a secret from me throughout our entire relationship. I ended the relationship on the pretext that he wasn't money/career motivated, he didn't say anything to the contrary.

I [F26] have been dating Will [M27] for most of 2014; I met him on New Years Eve, we exchanged numbers, scheduled a coffee date and have been seeing each other ever since. He's tall and shy, with long thick hair like Eddie Vedder. He lives in an older house by himself and drives a 1997 Toyota. He dresses very casually - I don't think he even owns a collared shirt - and all his clothes are minimum 1-2 years old. For income, he told me he ""ran a few websites"" and picked up piece-work as a 'session guitarist'. He is also very frugal. He never took me out for fancy dinners or anything. In the beginning it was always coffee dates, walks, hikes, etc. If we go out, he insists on 'pre-drinking' and refuses to buy drinks at a bar. Most nights he was content staying in, watching Netflix and playing his guitar.

I never outright asked how much money he made, but given his lifestyle, clothes, furnishings, etc. plus the fact that he rarely worked, I assumed it wasn't much. I would lightly prod him with questions about the future, if he had any career goals - he would say that he ""saw me in his future"", but also he was ""happy the way things were"". I have Facebook and am on it every day, usually when work is slow. Lately my newsfeed has been filled with my peers getting married, buying houses, having babies, and other various accolades. I can't help but feel jealous by this; it seems like everyone but me is making significant gains in their lives and relationships. Three weeks ago, after seeing a girl I knew from high school buy her 3rd property with her husband, it felt like my relationship with Will was juvenile and had no future.

The next time I was over at Will's (after he served me potato soup for dinner and was torrenting a documentary for us to watch later) I ended the relationship. I was perfectly honest about everything - he was a great guy, I loved him and his personality, but I felt he lacked career/life ambition and we wanted different things for the future. He sat and listened to everything, seemingly unmoved by it. When I finished talking, he said ""fine by me"" and asked me to leave. I went to hug him on my way out, instead he just guided me out the door and slammed it shut behind him. With prior boyfriends, we'd still talk or text a bit after we'd be broken up. Sometimes we'd even still hook up. I dunno, I've just never had a 'bad break-up' and always try to remain on good terms. I haven't heard a fucking word from Will, even after texting him multiple times and calling him once. I saw two of Wills friends at the gym today. I went over and made small talk, asked how he was, etc. I tried to explain myself, saying he was a great guy but our views on money and the future didn't seem to mesh. To this, one friend chuckled to himself and walked away. I asked the other friend WTF that's about it, and he says ""Yeah, we heard. The thing is, Will's loaded. He inherited his grandpas land which is leased to oil and gas companies. I've seen the quarterly checks he gets and they're more than my yearly salary. Good luck getting him to spend it, though. He has a 'if it aint broke, dont fix it' type mentality. Just look at that piece of shit he drives!"" This has completely baffled and upset me. I dated him for 10 months when I thought he was penniless, proof I'm not a fucking gold-digger. I am a 26 year old woman who needs to be pragmatic, I can't just indefinitely date someone with the future being so uncertain. He could've said something, ANYTHING during our break up when I was explaining my doubts about our relationship. Instead he said nothing, and now he refuses to talk to me. It makes absolutely no sense.

I just feel so low right now. If a man with disposable income meets a woman he likes, doesn't he want to treat her? He said he ""saw me in his future"", why didn't he care enough to share these things with me? He could have easily kept our relationship alive by being forthcoming. Someone please help me make sense of this situation.



""If a man with disposable income meets a woman he likes, doesn't he want to treat her? He said he ""saw me in his future"", why didn't he care enough to share these things with me?""
(into-the-abyss, 2015)

This again can be attributed to not only the evolutionary foundation of such thought processes and behaviors, but to the firm perpetuation of such standards by men on average. A study conducted in 2017 showed that while only a slight majority of women (56%) preferred for the man to pay the bill on a first date, a full 86% of men said that they preferred to do so (Murray). What this means is that the male self-professed desire to fit the provider role outpaces the female self-professed admission that fitting the provider role is necessary. In other words, men are actively inflating the standards of women by shoehorning themselves into the provider role at a greater rate than is potentially expected of them. Meanwhile, poor men are unable to compete with this standard.

If anyone wonders what is driving the ""hood rich"" phenomenon of driving a Beamer, Benz, or Bentley while their baby mama is still on food stamps, look no further.





Spoiler: 4.5: It's over for old men



This section is a bit harder to discuss in detail, as the definition of ""old"" changes based on the context. Let's look at the data first, then see why it's over in different but worsening ways for men as they age, as opposed to defining a clear line of what ""old"" is.

4.5a: The 40 year wall

One of the first and easiest places to draw a line is at 40 years old for a man.




(Rudder, 2015)

What this graph shows plainly is that at 40, a man's appeal has hit a ""wall"" of sorts. Women from 39 to 48 all prefer men in the 38-40 range (on average), the most significant such block in the data set. However, this sets us up for...

4.5b: The 50 year void
The appeal of older men climbs dramatically as women hit 49 and 50 - but they still prefer men in their mid 40's. Although the data is limited this leaves us begging the question: if 49 and 50 year old women prefer men who are in their mid 40's, who prefers 50 year old men? Until the data is gathered, we can only assume if we follow the trend, it would be women in their mid-50's. By this age, these women are undesirable to just about everyone. 50 year old men, who exist in the void of data and possible attraction, don't find women even close to that age appealing. Here's the male version of the graph we saw above:




(Rudder, 2015)

What this graph basically means is that 50 year old men are competing with just about every other age group for the same desirable age group of women; if our assumption is correct about women's preferences for 50 year old men, then this paints the following picture for a 50 year old man:

1. He, like all men, are attracted to women in their early 20's; however, he is also the one least likely to succeed with them.
2. He is attractive to women in their mid 50's; however, this is the age group of women that is decades older than the attractive level.

While success rates of 50 year old men with 55 year old women are unknown, the question is, how fortuitous is that success in the first place?




(Rudder, 2015)

In this expanded heatmap of male interest in women by age, we can clearly see that while almost all men are interested in women who are in their early 20s, there is a gradual accommodation for the aging of the male population as well (from 25 to 30, the upper bounds of what a man considers attractive to him increase annually). What is more interesting are the two other trends, and how they spell doom for both 40 and 50 year old men.

Trend 1:
From age 30 to 50, the amount of attraction men feel to women drops off almost entirely when the woman in question is over 35/36 years old.
For old men without standards, this may be a good thing - their female counterparts are now undesirable to an enormous demographic of former competitors. But again we must raise the question, how fortuitous is the potential success of a man at this age with a woman of the same age, if she is considered almost universally undesirable to the rest of men? What have you really ""won?""

If we consider the graphs above, we can determine that there are 2 great filters for the female population; after passing each, she is less desirable on average. The first filter is the 20-23 year range, which all men are competing and lusting for. For any woman who manages to get through this period without having been ""tied down"" to a provider role mate, it is important to question WHY this is the case. Certainly, divorces happen for a multitude of reasons, but some of those reasons are the fault of the woman in question. Some women focus more on their careers and education. Some women are left by ""no-good"" men. These are all potentially true and valid reasons to be single, but overall, should we be willing to extend the benefit of the doubt to the majority of single women who are above this age and still single? Can we say that the majority of women who are single after the age of 23 are single as a result of purely external forces that are powerful enough to overcome the fact that men of all ages found them to be at peak attractiveness just a year or two ago? Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any data that answers these questions, but I speculate that it is a definite leap of faith to assume that the average woman who is still single after 23 is single because of some external force; I find it more likely to be due to some external selection process. To put it bluntly, I believe that the likelihood of her being disproportionately undesirable in some way is greater than the likelihood of her being single by choice or preference.

The second filter is around the age of 35, as we mentioned before. The heat map clearly demonstrates that women between 23 and 35 are still desirable, albeit to a much lesser degree than their younger counterparts. What this also means is that the last remaining desirable women who did not find a permanent mate by the age of 23 have been mostly paired off by 35. After 35, there are basically no desirable women for men who are ages 30 and above. However, there is one exception, which is the foundation for Trend 2, which we will get to in a moment.

Let's first address the question: as an older man who obtained an older woman because she has less men competing for her, what have you really ""won?"" The data shows that you have a woman that managed to not be selected, or was selected and then rejected, through two great filters during which the vast majority of male attention was on her. With some obvious exceptions, such as widows and potentially doctors (though many female med students and doctors leave the professions once they find a similarly successful husband), these women are likely to be the equivalent of the fat kid who got picked last in gym class. The one exception, again, is the fact that...

Trend 2:
Men below the age of 30 are disproportionately interested in much older women, i.e. ""cougars.""
Whether the motivation is oedipal, fetishism, porn-induced, or based on the assumption that their partner wouldn't want to commit (thus opening the doors for ""no strings attached"" sex), men between the ages of 20 and 30 are all very interested in hunting cougars. This is particularly interesting given that men older than them no longer find them attractive, and why this discrepancy makes it even harder for old men.

Say you are one of those older men who is willing to settle for just about anything - be it a woman who has passed through the two filters and emerged as still single and undesirable to the majority, or a woman who is significantly older than peak attractiveness, or a woman who is older than you. You are now competing with young men who have, for whatever reason, a disproportionate interest in the same women. If posed with the inverse option (woman around your age or an early 20's female), which would you choose?

While it can be argued that because women find men closer to their age more attractive than men who are looking at women close to their age, as can be evidenced in the graph above demonstrating that all men prefer women close to the age of 20, the fact remains that both men and women decrease in desirability over time. This brings us to our next dividing line.

4.5c: The 30 year slope




(Rudder, 2010)

As can be clearly seen in the graph above, women reach peak desirability at around 20/21. Before we continue, for the sake of interest, compare the curve of female attraction above to the curve of female fertility below:




(Buss, 2016)

Moving on to the male curve, we see two clear facts: men peak between 25 and 30, and then fall off precipitously in terms of attractiveness. After age 30, a man will never be as desirable than he was prior to that point (on average). We can see this reflected in the previously listed Rudder graph:




(Rudder, 2015)

While the slope is not as pronounced as it is in the aggregate data, the average ""most desirable"" age for a man first falls below the age of the female rater precisely at 30, never to rise above it again. This means that after age 30, you will be most attractive to increasingly older and older women, which as we've seen above, are more likely to be closer to the bottom of the barrel as those above them have already been taken (""the good ones are already gone"").

While it may not be as over for 30 year olds as it is for 40 or 50 year olds, it will be increasingly more over for them as time goes on.

4.5d: Addendum: struggling as a younger man

If we take a look at the graph measuring desirability vs. age, we see another interesting fact represented therein: men don't peak until 25. What this means is that men who are younger than 25 actually have a lesser chance of success with any woman than men who are between 25 and 30. This was hypothesized earlier when provider roles were discussed, and the data backs it up. However, it is important to note that for young men, it is (on average) most certainly NOT over. It just hasn't begun yet.





Spoiler: 4.6: ""Juggernaut Theory"" is demonstrably true



Say you happen to struggle with one of the above situations; you are either too old, too young, poor, ethnic, ugly, or some combination thereof. What would be the easiest way to maximize your chances for success in the current sexual market without severely decreasing your standards?

The conclusion that you may come to is that you will pursue the ""quirky"" girl who is only ""low-key"" hot but still tickles your fancy. You show your classmate/coworker/friend/cat her picture and he says ""eh, she's not my type,"" which further fuels your belief that maybe, just maybe, you have a chance with her.

Unfortunately, this is the same conclusion that most men come to as well, and this is the basis of the ""Juggernaut Theory,"" which loosely states that the ""imperfections"" a woman may have actually make her more attractive and desirable. I have seen this be justified by the presence of various fetish orientations, such as ""chubby chasers"" and ""yellow fever."" What I haven't seen mentioned on the topic until now is that this effect is in fact so strong that it makes women whose looks aren't considered to be conventionally attractive actually MORE attractive than women who receive the same attractiveness rating but are more consistently rated attractive.

That was a bit of word vomit, so I'll let the pictures and Christian Rudder explain it more clearly. After reviewing 1.54 million votes, 596 thousand messages, and 64 thousand profiles, here are the findings:

""Every so often we run diagnostic plots like the one below, showing how many messages a sampling of 5,000 women, sorted by attractiveness, received over the last month.





These graphs are adjusted for race, location, age, profile completeness, login activity, and so on — the only meaningful difference between the people plotted is their looks. After running a bunch of these, we began to ask ourselves: what else accounts for the wide spread of the x’s, particularly on the “above-average” half of the graph? Is it just randomness?

What is it about her:





that gets more attention than her:





…even though according to our users, they’re both good-looking?""
(Rudder, 2011)

What the rest of the article begins to explore is the fact that the more that men disagree about a woman's looks, the more attention she gets overall. Here are bar graphs of each of the above women's ratings, along with information about how often they get messaged compared to the site average:




(Rudder, 2011)

Not only does the woman on the right, who rates slightly lower than the woman on the left on average, get more than double the site average amount of male attention, she gets almost three times as much attention as the woman on the left who is more consistently and universally considered attaractive.

After this initial experiment, Rudder thought that there must have been an error, and ran it over and over again, finding that regardless of the attractiveness of the pair of women chosen, as long as their male responses shared this discrepancy, this pattern held true. Here are two more examples:




(Rudder, 2011)




(Rudder, 2011)

Rudder postulates that what we call ""Juggernaut Theory"" is actually a derivative of Game Theory. Here is his explanation on the matter:

""Suppose you’re a man who’s really into someone. If you suspect other men are uninterested, it means less competition. You therefore have an added incentive to send a message. You might start thinking: maybe she’s lonely. . . maybe she’s just waiting to find a guy who appreciates her. . . at least I won’t get lost in the crowd. . . maybe these small thoughts, plus the fact that you really think she’s hot, prod you to action...

On the other hand, a woman with a preponderance of ‘4’ votes, someone conventionally cute, but not totally hot, might appear to be more in-demand than she actually is. To the typical man considering her, she’s obviously attractive enough to create the impression that other guys are into her, too. But maybe she’s not hot enough for him to throw caution (and grammar) to the wind and send her a message. It’s the curse of being cute.""
(Rudder, 2011)

It is easy to see how game theory can be seen as a derivative of evolutionary psychology in this case. As was discussed earlier in this post, men who are seeking casual sex and relationships are actively seeking women who have a greater amount of sexual accessibility; in other words, women with whom they think they have the greatest chance of hooking up with. However, this strategy paradoxically leads to greater competition for the woman in question. This subject will be continued in the next section.





Spoiler: 4.7: It's more over than it ever was before



What all of these potential pitfalls for men in the dating scene point to is that modern dating is very, very hard to succeed in as a man - unless you are NOT ugly, poor, ethnic, too old, too young, or finding yourself chasing Juggernauts.

What is it about modern dating that has made the strategies, that have been finely tuned by millions of years of evolution, actually backfire as they do in the case of the search for sexual accessibility being countered by Juggernaut theory?

To put it simply, this issue is multifaceted and complex, and I will only be able to address a couple of the contributing factors here. However, the beauty of evolutionary psychology is that one set of problem-solving techniques can explain a wide variety of questions. I will address some of those here:

Why have certain approaches seemingly changed with the times, while others have not?

Let us compare the evolutionary foundation of female selection to that of the Juggernaut theory.

Females have been selecting their mates based on certain values in both our species and others for millions of years. Some of those values seemingly produce detriments in the lives of males; a famous example is the peacock.





The male peacock boasts one of the most stunning visual displays aimed at attracting a mate. However, this massive tail does not come without a price. The brightly-colored peacock is so burdened by the tail that they struggle to fly over long distances or for a long duration, making them susceptible to predators. Beyond that, they are flamboyant, sporting a very rich color scheme that is also reflective in some parts. It is unsurprising that the same feathers that catch the female peacock's attention, also catch the attention of predators. So, how could such an evolutionary trait remain in the gene pool if the peacocks who are the most flamboyant are also the ones most susceptible to dying at the hands of a predator?

The answer lies in the fact that sexual selection is more powerful than even death, at least in the case of the peacock. If, for example, we have a population of peacocks in which 50 of the males are flamboyant, and 50 are neutral, then all 50 of the flamboyant ones would have to die before the 50 neutral ones are selected to reproduce. Once in a while, in times of desperation or extreme need, a female peacock may mate with a very dull male peacock, simply because she has no other options. However, because this is very rare, after a couple of generations within our sample populations of peacocks, the dull males' DNA will eventually be weeded out because they get selected for reproduction much less often than their flamboyant counterparts, even if the latter is also more likely to die.

So how does the peacock relate to our example of female selectivity for value? In humans, even though ""value"" as a definition has changed drastically since we left the trees in the jungle, waiting for a high value male has consistently yielded better results. Low value males' DNA has been systematically removed from our gene pool for millennia, and because this focus on high value males has led to consistent success, the selectivity of females continues on and on. While low value males are born and raised daily, this is due to a multitude of reasons, but ultimately none of them affect a females predisposition for selecting a higher value male. Similar to how ""the rich get richer, the poor get poorer,"" if a female is born as a product of a woman's selecting a high value mate, the offspring is likely to be of higher value than the offspring born to a woman who did NOT select a higher value mate. That means that in the second generation, the female born to the selected man will likely be of higher genetic value and will maintain her selectivity; in essence, selectivity is akin to breeding, as the most genetically gifted continue to have the luxury of selecting a mate who is similarly gifted. Remember the ""sexy sons"" hypothesis?

A perfect example of this are the rumors about the Olympic Village being a veritable sex party. Tinder has proven that the rumors are true:

""During the Winter Olympics Tinder has seen a 348% increase in overall Tinder usage in the Olympic Village, plus a 565% in right swipes and a 644% increase in matches.""
(Dating Sites Reviews, 2018)

When you put the most physically capable people, many of whom are at the pinnacle of genetic fitness, together in a small confined area, a sex bomb happens. It's like some sort of internal mechanism awakens in the men and women saying, ""you may never get a chance to mate with a person quite as genetically fit as this; you can't waste the opportunity."" The people who didn't make it to the Olympics as competitors are forced to watch from the sidelines and from the comfort of their living rooms, with no opportunity to share in the sexual pursuit of the greatest physical genetic potential on this planet.

In other words, to answer the first part of the question about why certain mating preferences have changed, the answer is that they only appear to have. Women on average don't seek the best hunter available to them in the West, they seek the most savvy businessman with the largest stock portfolio. However, in both cases, women were choosing based on ""value,"" which is subjective to the surroundings and demands of the life a woman leads. By the way, this may explain why some cougars end up humoring those younger men. Numerous testimonials go along the lines of, ""I already have money, a job, a house. What I don't have is hot steamy sex with a 20 year old man. I don't need him to provide for me, I just need his body."" Once the woman has provided for herself, she no longer seeks a man to fit the provider's role, and instead changes her preferences to aim for a different ""value"" - attractiveness.

Moving on, why does Juggernaut theory seem to contradict the hypothesis that successful reproduction yields the continuation of genetically induced behaviors and preferences? After all, the woman who is less consistently deemed attractive is receiving a lot more male attention than her more consistently attractive counterpart, shouldn't this leave a lot of men in the dust and wanting, resulting in their proclivity for chasing Juggernauts to be filtered out of the gene pool?

While it is certainly true that if those men never reproduce at all, their Juggernaut-chasing genes die with them. However, this is not always the case. After chasing Juggernauts over and over, eventually he may run into one that is not quite as inconsistently rated attractive as his previous crushes, much more of a plain Jane. His DNA, and thus the manual for what to do when it's time for his offspring to engage in sexual escapades of their own, carry on.

Let's not forget about the lucky guy who managed to land Ms. Juggernaut. While the rest of the men may have missed their chance, this is an example of how Juggernaut theory led to success. As we learned before, sexual selection is a powerful driving force; he was selected, and so was his Juggernaut-chasing DNA, by a Juggernaut no less!

So, to answer the second part of the question, mating preferences and strategies that seem destined for failure continue on in our gene pool because they succeed enough times for them to carry on, and when they don't succeed, that doesn't mean that the man (or woman) who has them in their DNA never gets to reproduce at all.

What is it about the digital age that makes it more over for undesirable men than it ever was before?

While, again, there are multiple interrelated contributing factors at play, we can summarize some of them to being a part of one overarching issue: unprecedented competition.

As mentioned earlier in the post, we have stone age minds trapped in modern skulls. What this means is that, as demonstrated in answering the previous question, certain strategies and attributes have been fine tuned and have persisted for millions of years. In contrast, the digital age, and particularly online dating, are extremely recent developments in the sexual market. For comparison, if we think of the entirety of the 2 million years as being a process of strengthening and re-strengthening strategies such as female selectivity and think of it as being the equivalent of a single human lifetime (~80 years), then the advent of online dating would have come around 9 hours and 49 minutes before you died. In other words, online dating has been around for so little time, that it hasn't had a sizeable impact on our genetic foundation yet.

So, for all intents and purposes, we can say that the women who use dating services are at least predisposed in the same ways that women were predisposed to select mates ten thousand years ago (which is also only a small fraction of the 2 million years that these predispositions have been self-correcting through sexual selection). Ten thousand years ago, a woman would see maybe a couple hundred different male individuals in her life time at MOST, with the number likely to be much, much lower. Compare this to the fact that by going on Tinder in even a mid-range city will net you hundreds of profiles to choose from in a single day.

What does this mean? It simply means that women have many more options to choose from than they did before, so their selectivity naturally weeds out an even greater number of men. However, if in the past, her selectivity had a high chance of yielding only one or no results at all due to a dearth of options, even the pickiest women is likely to find a few matches EVERY DAY as long as her location and age restrictions aren't TOO selective. In the past, a woman would only be able to select from men that are from her clan, or in her little hunter/gatherer community. Nowadays, a woman can metaphorically see available men for miles around her with the swipe of a touch screen. If there are no cute guys in your town, you can just expand your search to include the surrounding 10 miles. Thus, women are far more likely to find what they are looking for without having to lower their standards.

This is augmented by the advent of:

1. Transportation technology. You found this cute guy and want to go fool around, but he is 15 miles away? You can be there in 30 minutes thanks to your car.
2. Communication technology. You want to talk to him to see if his interests line up with yours? You can text him right now instead of having to go see him or writing him snail mail.
3. Mass media. The media shows what attractive men look like every second of every day in commercials, movies, YouTube videos, ads, etc.
4. Urbanization. If you live in the city, there are more available men closer to you than ever before.
5. Globalization. You have a particular fetish/preference? The chances of someone satisfying that interest are much greater than they ever have been in the more homogeneous societies that existed not too long ago (and continue to exist in some areas, admittedly).

... and many many more.

Keep in mind that online dating is not only becoming more and more accepted in society, it is also becoming more prevalent in outcome relationships. According to the statistics, 1/3rd of modern marriages arise from relationships that started online on services like OkCupid, Tinder, Match.com, etc. They are far and away the leader in creating unions in same-sex couples, and are already firmly the second-most common point of origin for heterosexual couples (Ortega & Hergovich, 2017). In this rapidly evolving sexual market, it is the people who are worst equipped for online dating that are the ones who are left behind. It is imaginable that if this trend continues, we eventually will see shifts in human biology that reflect the dating and mating strategies and standards that are most successful in online dating.

How rampant is the selectivity nowadays?

Anyone with a search engine and enough interest can watch videos or view screenshots of how attractive women and even men experience dating services like Tinder. They log on, begin swiping, and receive hit after hit after hit. Messages upon messages. Compare this to the following statistics from 2014:

""50 million people use Tinder every month.
There are more than 1 billion profile swipes per day on Tinder.
Tinder makes 12 million matches made per day.""
(Shontell, 2014)

That means that out of 1 billion swipes, only 1.2% result in a match. If we know that some individuals have the greatest chance of success, with videos showing a much higher percentage of successful swipes for them, where does that leave the rest of us? In other words, that 98.8% selectivity rate includes the most attractive members of society. Imagine what the success percentage rate is for men who are unattractive, ugly, ethnic, poor, too old, too young, or any combination of these undesirable qualities?






Closing Thoughts

Spoiler: Part 5



What I hoped to demonstrate throughout the course of this post is that certain blackpills have strong empirical support for their veracity, both in scientific theory, study, and in the enormous data generated by dating websites and services. Even if we ignore all other factors potentially contributing to inceldom (especially shirking the factors that are merely associated with incels because of the actions of a few individuals), we still have a substantial foundation for asserting that dating in the digital age is incredibly difficult for those among us who are, as I've said numerous times, unattractive, ugly, ethnic, poor, too old, too young, or any combination of these undesirable qualities. This is what the blackpill is really about: the truth, supported by facts. When studies and data like this exist, it is impossible to swallow bluepilled ideologies such as ""just put yourself out there"" and ""just be confident"" when there are many inherent things about a man that can make him objectively undesirable in the sexual market.

After posting this thread, I will try to update both it and this post as I stumble upon more resources and information pertaining to the subject. For now, I have placed a quote in the ""Miscellaneous Quotes + Information"" section that I couldn't quite fit into my piece in its entirety, but I think is very interesting; this is where I will be placing the majority of consequent additions to the content.

Finally, I would like to thank the psychologists, researchers, corporate databases, journalists, authors, community members, and my colleagues whose work made this post a reality. I hope that future readers find it informative. Cheers.

Another study proves the halo effect,Blackpill,Deleted member 2119,"Mar 22, 2018",15000,28,"Title : "" Facial esthetics and the assignment of personality traits before and after orthognathic surgery rated on video clips.""

Short summary : Every patient's face was assessed twice before and after treatment in changing sequence, by 155 naïve raters with similar age to the patients. The raters provided independent estimates on aesthetic trait pairs like ugly /beautiful, and personality trait pairs like dominant /flexible. Furthermore the perception of attractiveness, intelligence, health, the persons' erotic aura, faithfulness, and five additional items were rated.
we found that the intervention significantly and effectively altered the perception of the personality trait self-confidence. 
The effect size was highest in Class III patients, smallest in Class II patients, and in between for patients with Laterognathia. All dysgnathic patients benefitted from orthognathic surgery. We conclude that motion can mitigate marked stereotypes but does not entirely offset the mostly negative perception of dysgnathic faces.

It's now widely accepted among those who work in genetics that roughly 10 per cent of us are not fathered by the man we believe to be dad.
Geneticists have stumbled upon this phenomenon in the course of conducting large population studies and hunting for genes that cause diseases such as cystic fibrosis. They find full siblings to be half-siblings, fathers who are genetic strangers to more than one of their children and uncles who are much closer to their nieces and nephews than anyone might guess. Lumped under the heading of ""pedigree errors,"" these so-called mis-paternities, false paternities and non-paternities are all science jargon for the unwitting number of us who are chips off someone else's block.

Some articles say it is as high as 30% in those actually taking paternity tests.

http://www.rense.com/general51/chsup.htm




The sample size of 300,000+ DNA tests a year suggests that, as an upper limit, 30% of all children are conceived by a man other than the one named by the mother. With ~4 million children now born each year in the United States, 1.2 million men are likely victims of paternity fraud each year.

"[Hard To Swallow Edition] - Love & Happiness Don't Exist, Female Validation Is Not Valuable",Blackpill,BlkPillPres,"Jan 4, 2019",25000,91,"I'll never understand the men (especially incels) who endlessly chase after these illusory concepts like ""love"", ""happiness"" and ""female validation"".

LOVE:
Love doesn't exist, not in the ""cultural sense"", where its this deep meaningful thing, its just a series of chemical reactions used to increase the likeliness of pair bonding and reproduction, its our brains using us like puppets to carry out a desired function. You didn't miss out on anything, it would be like a person who never had a lucid dream saying they missed out on an ""out of body experience"", it isn't really that, nobody actually ""astrally projects"" themselves, its all in your head, a trick the brain plays on us. I never get the people who feel regret for not experiencing things that we know aren't real..

There is no such thing as ""love"", its all lust, and the feeling of ""love"" is nothing but our brains giving us an excuse to take pride in lust, because when someone feels ""justified"" in something they will do it more fervently, its our brain playing its typical puppet tricks, in an alternate reality our brains will inflict pain on our bodies to get us to reproduce, because we evolved differently, so instead of taking the ""coercion and deception"" approach our brains take the ""force and blackmail"" approach.

Humans love doing things that are pleasurable, but more than that we love stroking our ego while doing said things, because it makes it both mentally and physically enjoyable, we need these ""mental passes"" to give us the ""go ahead"", the ""justification"" to pursue things that are not really ""morally good"", we ascribe morals to the act to make it mentally easier for us to do.

I talk about this in detail in another thread - https://incels.is/threads/normies-l...ired-to-realize-their-core-motivations.97039/

Where I make the distinction between ""core motivations"" (what were actually trying to do) and ""surface motivations"" (the ""veils"" that cover ""core motivations"" that make us feel justified in committing said act).



BlkPillPres said:



Most music likes to affirm love as this almost ""moral"" and ""deep"" thing that just must be good and you're definitely a good person for feeling it, but at its core LOVE IS SELFISH, it is driven by selfishness, its the desire to possess someone else, their very being, and have that exist for your sake, for your ""happiness"" (pleasure). Notice how meta that was, another example popped up within an example, the ""surface/veiled motivation"" is ""happiness"" but the ""core/actual"" motivation is PHYSICAL PLEASURE (there are both psychological [ownership and dependency] and physical [pleasure] ""core motivations"" propping up the ""surface motivation"" of ""love""). Normies don't want to think about ""dark"" shit like that, they only want the ""warm fuzzies"" of life so they can stroke their egos and avoid an existential crisis (two birds one stone).

The ""core motivation"" of all things are selfish and usually immoral, it is always about the person even when they convince themselves otherwise.

Religion is a good example of this:

""Do you LOVE RELIGION or do you simply HATE THE THOUGHT OF CEASING TO EXIST AFTER DEATH""

and within that there's also:

""Do you LOVE GOD or do you simply HATE BEING TORTURED FOR ETERNITY""

Its quite obvious which one is the actual motivation, its the one that is always veiled beneath the other, the ""surface motivation"" is always something that is seen as ""moral"" or ""good"" and is used to cover the TRUE MOTIVATION, the ""core motivation"".

Its like a symbiotic relationship within your psyche, both help eachother to survive and both have some positive benefit to the individual, the ""surface motivation"" is all about the dopamine reward system, you feel good about yourself and that in turn feels good for your body, the ""core motivation"" is all about survival, its driven by our survival instincts, the desires and urges that push us, its about keeping the individual alive and satisfied.

Click to expand...


Love is just a ""surface motivation"" for the ""core motivation"" of physical pleasure (lust, orgasms, etc).

HAPPINESS:
Happiness is subjective, it is rarely if ever truly attained because its standard is determined by the beliefs and mindset of the person chasing after it, it is dictated by two variables (Personal Standards and/or Ignorance of Standards). There are people out there in life whose lives are complete shit in comparison to ours in terms of standards of living, but they are ""happier"" than us, and they want to keep living while we feel suicidal, and that's because of:

1. Personal Standards - Their standards for existence are low, they don't want for much, could be because they'd suffered so much in life before that the meager pleasures they have now are enough in comparison to the past, could be because they have low self esteem and consider what they currently have ""enough for someone like me"", at the end of the day, they are ""happy"" based on the standards of living they have for their own life.

2. Ignorance of Standards - They are unaware of how much better their standards of living could be (e.g. someone born in some remote/tribal village/community with barely any technology). For example someone born in an amish community and is never exposed to any technology or modern media, or someone born in a monastery in some mountain in china and they have never left that community. They likely feel more satisfied and fulfilled with life than we ever will, but that's simply because they don't know what they are missing out on. If a 10/10 stacy walked up into said monastery in a bikini and an Ipad with a movie playing on it, that same guy who had ""discovered nirvana"" (a state of perfect happiness and enlightenment) would lose his shit and that would throw his peace out the window, he'll now realize many things he wanted deep down that he wasn't even truly aware of, entertainment, to have his lust satiated rather than repressed and controlled, etc.

The Amish are a better example of this, they have this rite of passage called Rumspringa,

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumspringa




The usual behavioral restrictions are relaxed, so that Amish youth can acquire some experience and knowledge of the non-Amish world.

Amish adolescents may engage in rebellious behavior, resisting or defying parental norms. In many cultures, enforcement may be relaxed, and misbehavior tolerated or overlooked to a degree. A view of rumspringa has emerged in popular culture that this divergence from custom is an accepted part of adolescence or a rite of passage for Amish youth.

Among the Amish, however, rumspringa simply refers to adolescence. During that time a certain amount of misbehavior is unsurprising and is not severely condemned (for instance, by Meidung or shunning).

A minority of Amish youth do diverge from established customs. Some may be found:

Wearing non-traditional clothing and hair styles (referred to as ""dressing English"")
Driving vehicles other than horse-drawn vehicles (for communities that eschew motor vehicles)
Not attending home prayer
Drinking and using other recreational drugs


Click to expand...


A lot of amish youths after going through this period never return to their communities because they now know the life they are missing out on, the phrase ""ignorance is bliss"" means ""ignorance is happiness"", its part of happiness, not knowing what you're missing out on allows you to set lower standards for happiness, and the mere introduction of those things into your consciousness destroys any peace of mind you had, your happiness is now sub par because you know your life could be more enjoyable now.

You can cope and deny all you want at that point, but you'll always know deep down its true.

Happiness is based on the limitations one places on themselves (ego, goals, etc) and the limitations that life placed on them (birth place, physical/mental disabilities, etc)

That's why I don't aspire to be ""happy"", I aspire to be ""physically satisfied"" and ""stress free"", that criteria is much more objective than ""being happy"", because talk to the average person who says they are ""happy"" and they live stressful and problematic lives, and that's because their personal standards for themselves revolves around ""facing challenges"", so they never stop chasing after more stresses in life, and they are always stuck wondering why they never feel ""truly satisfied"". Its because they are playing the game wrong, life isn't an endless series of achievements to be met, and that's the mindset (((they))) have indoctrinated onto the masses to keep us ""happy and busy worker drones"" while they actually enjoy what a fulfilling life is aboue (peace and prosperity).

FEMALE VALIDATION:
A lot of incels hold on to multiple concepts that contradict eachother.

They believe things about women related to evolution psychology that devalue their existence (they are genetically hardwired to be hypergamous, inherently selfish, etc), while at the same time they value their validation and what they think of them, those are two contradictory concepts, if women are as bad as the black pill tells us, and we truly believe it, then there is no reason to value anything they think.

I've been saying this for a while, nobody really wants female validation, we've just been indoctrinated over years as children and basically socialized to value and chase after it, that's because female validation is the prerequisite to what we really want, sex. Well its the prerequisite to attaining sex the ""usual way"" (courtship), you can just pay for it.

Its completely contradictory to both acknowledge that women are basically instinct driven and illogical, and yet somehow value whether or not they admire you or think highly of you. They are basically like an AI running lines of code, would you care if an AI, something that has no true concept of reality and merely does what its ""code"" dictates, cares about you? (I doubt it).

Of what value is its evaluation of you, when it has no true sense of self. How can you devalue women as an existence, while at the same time claiming that their evaluation of you is something that matters (do you see the obvious contradiction yet?).

That would be like me saying I have a broken mirror, yet I trust its ability to give me an accurate reflection. One should only value the evaluation given by someone relative to how much they value the logical integrity of said person, in other words, if you truly believe everything the black pill says, then by valuing female validation, aren't you putting stake in the competency of a group of individuals, you yourself deem as incompetent?

Female validation is just the usual prerequisite to attaining sex, it is not the goal it is the prerequisite to achieving the goal, and only a foolish egoist chases after validation, as black pillers were supposed to be introspective, the ""deep thinkers"", to cling and chase after female validation is illogical, especially for an incel, you already know what it is you really want, sex, so chase after that, and when you simply see things in such a manner a whole slew of options open up to you, things you did not even consider because your ego was blinding you from it."

"Response To: ""You're Not Entitled To Sex""",Blackpill,BlkPillPres,"Dec 16, 2018",87000,204,"1. Nobody is entitled to anything

Entitlements are a figment of imagination, they exist only in the minds of humans, and function only within societies where they are allowed to function, and are facilitated (usually through tax collection to fund said ""entitlement programmes"")

Pension, welfare, clean water, education, nobody is really entitled to any of it if were being objective and honest.

2. Incels don't feel entitled to sex, they simply WANT sex

I keep seeing the ""entitlement"" argument repeated everywhere and it is literally just a strawman argument, propping up a stance so absurd that you can't help but be right being against it, heck even I agree with being against it, because its egotistical and illogical for anyone to think they literally DESERVE anything, a normies reasoning for being against it would likely be more emotionally based though, more like - ""women are people too, this is so misogynistic, its so hurtful, etc, etc"".

Are there a few incels actually going around saying and believing that they ""deserve"" sex and are entitled to it, yes, but those men are idiots, they are outliers, any logical person knows full well nobody ""deserves"" anything. Most incels adhere to the ""black pill philosophy"", and a key ""tenant"" of that is basing ones life choices and interpretation of observations, on cold hard logic, so I doubt most incels (or even 5% of incels) actually believe they DESERVE sex

Incels simply just want, just like every other human on this planet that wants, to try and paint incels as this collective of egotistical males, that all think they are entitled to sex (women's bodies) is a falsehood that is often peddled by the media and society at large.

You see because its much easier to simply create a false narrative that can be argued against, than to argue against the actual thing. Paint incels as malicious and egotistical instead of frustrated and suicidal, and its much easier to demonize incels and garner support against them.

3. Disenfranchised Males = Self Destructive Males

There's this african proverb that I think perfectly describes whats taking place between modern society and average/below average males.

""If the young are not initiated in the tribe, they will burn down the village just to feel its warmth.""

Modern society is extremely sexualized, there is no escape from sex as a man in these times, which is why it feels like you're being trolled whenever people say the all too cliche phrase ""sex isn't the most important thing in life"", nice strawman argument, now simply wanting sex because its being shoved down your throat at every waking moment, is equal to thinking its the most important thing in the world. Statements like that are nothing but dismissive shaming and silencing tactics.

Sex is in the news papers, magazines, tv, movies, video games, its in advertisements, bill boards, the internet, etc. People need to try and understand how ""dystopian"" of a reality this would all seem to a man who is unable to acquire sex due to unrealistic and unfair female standards that only exist due to various societal changes that resulted from feminism. Its like a sick joke were forced to live through. Everyone is telling us to just ""get over it"" while ironically enjoying sex lives themselves and boasting/talking about it at every waking moment.

Imagine if you woke up and basically everyone on the planet had an expensive sports car, all you see are people around you driving it, everyone with a sports car gets treated differently than those who don't, they have higher social status, etc. For some reason you can't get one no matter how much you adhere to the advice suggested by sports car owners. Everytime you complain about the biased system that keeps you from getting one, someone tells you - ""there are more important things in life than sports cars"", they then later proceed to talk with their friends about all the awesome sports cars they drove, post about the current sports car they have leased, and make instagram and other media posts about how great their sports car driving life is and how great they are at driving sports cars.

Quite obviously these people are being disingenuous, they know your complaints are legitimate, they don't actually follow their own words and they glorify sports cars and ownership of it ad nauseum, really they just want people without sports cars to STFU and deal with it, live without having a sports car and stop ruining the experience for the rest of them. Its really fucked up but that is societys mindset towards men who can't get sex, they know that argument is BS, they know they are lying and sex is of the utmost importance to every human (its not the most important thing, but its really really up there on the list, some might argue 2nd or 3rd place). They only repeat this BS because its really just about shaming and silencing men for daring to make society even feel a tad bit guilty or responsible for our current state of being disenfranchised. They really just expect incels to ""STFU and take one for the team"".

Sex is clearly a vital part of every humans existence, a man doesn't even ""become a man"" in a sense within society until he has sex, in essence a lot of men have not undergone their ""right of passage"" to become part of the ""tribe"" that is modern human civilization.

This is why all of these mass shootings are taking place, its started to branch off into other things like the ""Thot Audit"", more and more things like this are going to keep happening until society finally acknowledges this problem and begins to make changes.

So as it stands we now have a significant and growing pool of sexually starved men, who due to this are angry, violent, irritable and suicidal, seriously how does society expect this to play out, the most dangerous animal is the one backed into a corner with nothing to lose, when someone doesn't care if they die, worse yet they want to die just so their sad existence can end, there is no reasoning with that person, they are on a ""war path"", you either kill them, give that person what they want, or you get out of their way as they proceed to claim what they want.

Society expects us not to burn the village down when it won't initiate us into the tribe, that's whats truly outrageous, not the violence of disenfranchised men, but the fact that society actually expects us to just remain docile and accept this reality that has been forced upon us.

4. Women aren't entitled to safety

People don't seem to understand the danger of looking the collective male populace in they eyes, and telling them they aren't entitled to something that not too long ago they would just taking by force as a norm.

Men reformed themselves and created societies with laws and codes of conduct because it benefited the collective, especially the collective male populace, this was the function of ""patriarchal societies"". To manage a safe and fair distribution of resources, and that includes sexual and reproductive resources.

Virginity was a prerequisite for a woman to be ""marriage material"" because men wanted to be sure that when they married a woman she would be less likely to cheat, as she'd be more likely to be satisfied sexually with her partner due to lack of ""sexual experience"". It also ensured that your investment would be worth it as you aren't footing the bill for ""used goods"", that may sound cruel but men have to basically invest a lot into a woman's very being, even more so today, get divorced once and half of your wealth goes to another person, and these days the women aren't even virgins, marriage is truly a raw deal in this modern era.

Marriage as an institution existed for various reasons, it was used to create familial ties, for political reasons, etc, but most importantly to give a sense of assurance to men that the children their wives gave birth do were indeed theirs (hence virginity being the key defining trait of ""marriage material""), and they could pass down their name and wealth to their children.

For the same reason Female Promiscuity was shamed and led to social ostracization. Womens hypergamy had to be kept in check otherwise the relationship dynamics between men and women would fall apart and so would the ""family unit"" which is basically the ""building block"" of society.

Crimes like Rape were especially frowned upon because it made a woman unfit for marriage and ruined her entire life, it also went against the civility agreement between men who as a collective all wanted their respective women in their lives to be safe and remain ""their women"" and not be ""tarnished"" by another man.

I hope people get the point here, the purpose of these laws and societal norms were to ensure a code of conduct amongst men, so that we would as a collective agree to allow each other to pursue and court women in a safe and organized manner, unimpeded by other men in an ""unfair"" manner, we all had a fair chance. There was a ""social contract"" at play here.

In these modern times the social contract is no longer functioning, expecting men not to regress and go back to the days of rape and violence when the contract is no longer being enforced and/or adhered to, is what is truly outrageous, and not the acts themselves. Men aren't entitled to sex?, true I agree, but women aren't entitled to safety either, they never were entitled to it and they never will be, it was a ""provision"" offered by men to women for co-operating with men to facilitate the social contract. The safety resided within the rule set of the social contract, which is no longer at play here, so a significant and increasing number of males are seeing no reason to function as ""civil"" men, there's no logical reason too, why be civil when you essentially are not even part of civilization, civility its no longer to our benefit. Women's actions have thrown the entire system out of order, and the violent responses of men today are retaliatory. Society is basically trying to make average/below average males into somewhat of a ""slave class"" that offers their labor and utility, contributes to society, all while being barred from enjoying a basic pleasure that all the female citizens get to enjoy despite contributing less and having to risk their lives less.

Ask yourself who are really the crazy ones, the men who go out committing acts of violence or ""opt out"" of society, or the society that expected these men not to do this, despite significantly ruining the quality of life for the collective male populace, and having the gall to ask them to keep up their end of the social contract and be ""good little boys and contribute to society as upstanding citizens"" . Are you fucking serious, no wonder men are opting out of society, no wonder men are going out on murder rampages.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnmauldin/2017/03/09/american-men-are-giving-up-on-jobs/

There's no real motivation to bother trying, to be a ""hard worker"", to be ""civilized"", when your reward at the end of the day is to get married to used goods who is likely only settling for you because she's aged past her prime and has a ton of baggage, to top it off with no fault divorce laws she can easily just leave with half of your wealth, and modern society actually celebrates and endorses female promiscuity and cheating on men, so that great investment you made isn't even guaranteed to be solely yours to enjoy JFL. Men have literally no motivation to be ""good people"", anyone who thinks people should be ""good"" for the sake of ""being good"" is an illogical idiot that doesn't get how reality actually works.

In the bible there's heaven and hell, in human laws there are cash rewards for helping law enforcement with certain tasks, and there are fines and jail time for committing crimes or breaking minor laws.

GOOD AND EVIL CAN ONLY BE TRULY (OBJECTIVELY) DEFINED BY THE FACT THAT THERE ARE REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS ASSOCIATED RESPECTIVELY, that is how we truly distinguish a good act from a bad one, if we rely on subjective opinion based criteria then anyone and everyone is both right and wrong, good and bad, based on their own personal reasonings and whims. If the bible said that no matter what you do everyone goes to heaven, but ""please still don't sin"" nobody would give a fuck about the rules, most every Christian would be sinning without any restraint or repentance, rules mean nothing without a reward and punishment system in place.

To address another cliche statement - ""where have all the good men gone"", I ask ""by what objective criteria are you ascribing the label ""good"" "". Reinstate a sufficient ""rewards system"" for males and you'll see all those men come running back."

For AFS, the team included 397,338 pooled individuals (214,547 women and 182,791 men) from the UK Biobank – a database containing in-depth genetic and health information from half a million UK participants. For AFB, researchers included 542,901 individuals (418,758 women and 124,008 men) from 36 previous studies.

Is the Male Sex Drive the Cause of Wars? - Psychology Today



Our latest research on the male warrior hypothesis, which was published last week in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, the oldest science journal in the world, offers an explanation.

'Wars caused by male sex drive,' says scientists - The Independent



Male sex drive is at the root of most conflict in the world, from football violence to wars, scientists claim.

A review of psychological evidence concludes that men are shaped by evolution to be aggressive towards ""outsiders"". The tendency, at the heart of all inter-tribal violence, emerged through natural selection as a result of competition for mates.

Today it can be seen in wars as well as clashes involving rival gangs, football fans or religious groups, say researchers.

The Cause of All War Boils Down to Sex and Social Status: Here's Why - Business Insider



The real question is, how have we evolved as individuals to fight for our groups? When you dig into it and you look at the data, there are only two things that are worth risking yourself in war for, as an individual. The first thing is an increase in social status. And the reason why that's worth risking yourself for is, as you rise up the status hierarchy, particularly as a man — and men do most of the fighting — you get more mates, more sexual mates. When you have more mates, you have more children. That's a reason to risk fighting in war.

But there's another reason why people fight in war. That's to ensure that they have membership of an in-group. This in-group could be a tribe or a nation-state. It's the same mechanism. It's the thing that causes us as humans to feel belonging. It's the thing that makes you feel homesick. It's the thing that sends shivers down your spine when you're at a political rally, or a football match, or you're singing in a choir in church. These are the mechanisms in your brain causing you to seek to belong.

Is male libido the ultimate cause of war? - Research Digest



From the mighty clash of two stags rutting, to the dawn raid of a chimpanzee, much violence in nature is perpetrated by males fighting each other in competition for female mates. A new study claims it’s a similar story with humans. Cultural differences, limited resources and technological developments all play a role, but a team of psychologists based in China and Hong Kong believe the ultimate cause of human war rests with the male libido. Historically, they argue that the lure of an attractive female primed the male brain for conflict with other males, an effect that persists in modern man even though its usefulness is largely outdated.

Across four experiments Lei Chang and his team showed that pictures of attractive women or women’s legs had a raft of war-relevant effects on heterosexual male participants, including: biasing their judgments to be more bellicose towards hostile countries; speeding their ability to locate an armed soldier on a computer screen; and speeding their ability to recognise and locate war-related words on a computer screen. Equivalent effects after looking at pictures of attractive men were not found for female participants.

The effects on the male participants of looking at attractive women were specific to war. For example, their ability to locate pictures of farmers, as opposed to soldiers, was not enhanced. Moreover, the war-priming effects of attractive women were greater than with other potentially provocative stimuli, such as the national flag. Finally, the men’s faster performance after looking at women’s legs versus flags was specific to war-related words, as opposed to merely aggressive words.

“The mating-warring association, as shown in these experiments … presumably unconsciously propels warring behaviour because of the behaviour’s past, but not necessarily current, link to reproductive success,” the researchers said. They conceded their study had several limitations, not least that war is a collaborative endeavour whilst they had studied individual responses. However, the new results chime with past lab research, showing for example that men, but not women, respond to intergroup threat by increasing their within-group cooperation. And they chime with anthropological research, which has found male warriors in traditional tribal societies have more sexual partners than other men, as do male members of modern street gangs.

“… This is among the first empirical studies to examine the potential mating-warring association,” the researchers concluded. “As such this study adds to the diversities of evidence on the effects of mating motives in human males as well as motivating further discussions of the origins of human warfare.”

Click to expand...

So looking at hot women and their legs makes men more prone to war but not national flags or anything. and male warriors in traditional tribal societies alongside male gang members have more sex partners (and the study cited showed that gang leaders have the most partners).

Another study had found that the reason men historically fought in wars was because they worried if they didn't, their wives would cheat on them with other men. this gave them incentive to fight off to war to prevent cuckoldry. There's also some anecdotal and theoretical evidence that jihadists and Islamic terrorists commit terrorist attacks due to sexual frustration because their societies prohibit premarital sex, masturbation and encourage waiting until marriage which won't happen until their mid-late 20s/early 30s. These men commit violence due to feeling emasculated by their virginity and their desire to experience death by suicide bombing so they can experience attractive women in heaven, with the Quran being misinterpreted by them as promising women in heaven. Some anecdotes from Muslim terrorists show they experience sexual frustration over virginity.

Other studies show that physically aggressive men have more sexual partners, and the more physically aggressive he is, the more partners he has. Studies also found that women find physically aggressive men attractive for short-term encounters/flings but not long-term relationships. 

Another thread I started earlier is about how studies have shown how criminals have more reproductive partners and how prisoners have more sex partners (not including their prison sex partners/rape victims). Studies have shown a lot of evidence that crime/violence is subconsciously or consciously done to attract female mates and have sex partners. Read more detail there. I have also read research about rapists and how peer pressure to have, the desire to have as many sex partners as possible, and viewing women as conquests, and sexual gratification are the primary motives for rape, shattering the myth that it's only about power over women (that could just be a secondary motive). Rapists have been shown to have consensual sex, and have far more sexual partners than most men and more dating partners. Some studies have shown that among non-pedophilic child molesters (child molesters who aren't attracted to children), they might molest children due to inability to be with an adult partner (such as an adult they are attracted to and wish to but afraid to pursue) so they pick children as a substitute. These are called regressive abusers. Most child molesters are not pedophiles but situational offenders. These child molesters might molest due to insecurity, curiosity, stress, a desire to hurt a loved one of the child, marital problems, sexual experimentation, etc. Studies have also shown that school bullies have more sex partners, and that bullies bully others subconsciously or consciously to get laid and as an effective mating strategy and bullying is part of evolution and a strategy. The only exception to this is that bullying is NOT a mediating effect for extraversion being positively associated with getting laid, showing that extroverts get laid through their extraversion, and that unless you're far more extroverted than average, bullying would be a factor in why you got laid when you engaged in bullying. Studies also show that bullies tend to be popular among their peers (except bully/victims, those who are bullies and victims at the same time. they have low popularity). Bullies tend to get laid more and this is particularly true for boys who physically bully (aka violence). Bullies don't bully due to having a shitty life, or low self-esteem or depression, with studies showing they actually have low insecurity, high self-esteem and low rates of depression. Studies have shown bullying is about increasing social status, and studies show middle/high school bullies bully their friends and people they have mutual friends with far more than they bully non-friends, and that outcasts are just as likely to be bullies as popular people. the study found people bully those with the same social status as them to increase their own social status. this makes sense, as relational bullying becomes more common in middle/high school than elementary school (elementary has more physical bullies) and people engage in gossip or character assassination to lower others' social status and increase their own. This explains why studies show that among popular people, the #1 most popular person is the nicest whereas ones who aren't are more likely to be bullies. So now you can see bullying is part of evolution. Men act violence towards other men to get laid, and once they achieve mating success, the likelihood drops. Adult virgins usually engage in less risk-taking behaviors, and are more likely to be bullied/socially withdrawn or rejected by peers when growing up. In adulthood, they tend to be in poorer physical/mental health and are less satisifed with their social lives. They also are more likely to be obese, and bullying victims are more likely to be overweight throughout adulthood. This is line with the fact that the vast majority of people on this forum were bullied growing up. A fair amount of users on this forum here and there were even bullied in adulthood. 

TLDR: Sex is the root of all evil, war, violence and crime in this world, especially if perpetrated by men. Feminists complain that men are violent, but women cause men to be violent and reward them with sex for that. So this is why society long ago tried to restrict sex, but if terrorists in Islam are terrorists due to sexual frustration, then that means that restricting sex was a double edge sword but so is the sexual revolution when it tries to permit sex, an activity that is the #1 cause of war/violence. Both have consequences, and eliminating sex from this world would be much better because evolution wouldn't be as pronounced in this world. Women also cause toxic masculinity by putting pressure on men to conform to as many macho stereotypes as possible (assertive, confident, stoic, doesn't cry, never insecure, sexually experienced, taller than me, stronger than me, dominant, etc.) Maybe if women didn't exist, men wouldn't be the way they are because sex wouldn't be part of producing children and evolution wouldn't be as important. The simultaneous existence of sexual intercourse/sexual activity and two sexes (male and female) causes the worst issues on Earth, like war, crime and violence. Eliminate one of the two (or even both) to stop this from happening. Fuck everything, just annihilate humanity. Blow up Earth too so evolution doesn't start again. Turns out that thugmaxxing is a useful thing.

A case study into the avi halo effect on incels.is (BRUTAL FOID WORSHIP PILL),Experiment,subhuman,"Apr 30, 2022",16000,118,"About 12 days ago I made a thread called ""Why do incels with anime foid avis tend to get simped for"". In this thread, I made the hypothesis that incels with anime foid avis get more attention, and I attempted to find reasons to explain this.








why do incels with anime foid avis tend to get simped for?


i notice people with anime foid avis are treated differently on here. a lot of times people are a lot more flirtatious with interacting with them and always mention how hot their avi is. one explanation for this is that i think some people hope that behind the picture there is a real girl that...




incels.is





About 2 days after I made that, I switched my avi from the shy boys guy to Ryuko Matoi from Kill La Kill to test my hypothesis:




Figure 1: my original avi, from the shy boys documentary, the control group



Figure 2: Ryuko Matoi, the test

I monitored the threads, the views, and the replies and created a data set. I then cleaned and analyzed the data using R. For example, I removed my pinned thread from the dataset because it was an outlier. I made a lot of high IQ quality threads that should have been pinned, but that was the only one. Also, I removed sewers posts because they get considerably less replies and views on average, which would skew the data. After this, I used ggplot to create graphical representations of the data. The results are astonishing.



Figure 3: The number of views on my threads I get based on my avi

This graph shows that although my Ryuko threads got more views on average, they were comparable. As a result, I can conclude that your avi has no determining influence on the number of views your thread gets. However, the next finding is going to blow your mind.



Figure 4: The number of replies my threads got based on the avi

As you can see, despite the number of views being comparable, my Ryuko threads got substantially more replies than my shy boys avi. On average, my Ryuko threads got almost 10 more replies. This is completely insane. This means just by having a cute anime foid avi, you are going to receive much more attention on this forum. As you can see with the quartiles and the dots, this isn't very much affected by the outliers. Most Ryuko threads got more replies than 75% of my threads with the shy boys avi, while half of my threads with the shy boys avi got less replies than 75% of my Ryuko threads.

Concluding remarks: If you want to get the most out of this forum, change your avi to a hot anime foid. Despite this forum ostensibly being against foid worship and simping, many incels are actually much bigger simps and foid worshippers than they care to admit (shoutout to @K9Otaku). For further research, I would like to work with a more expansive data set that includes multiple users. Since my threads are generally always high IQ and good quality, this may be a contributing factor to the reply count. Also, I would like to analyze individual post replies rather than threads.

SCIENTIFIC PROOF that the order of importance is: Race > Height > Face > Money,Blackpill,RageAgainstTDL,"Jul 9, 2018",67000,218,"Race > Height > Face > Money

Highlights:
- Being Asian costs you $247,000 extra per year compared to a white guy.
- Being 5'7"" costs you $150,000 extra compared to a 5'11"" guy, or $180,000 compared to a 6'2"" guy.
- Being bottom 10% facially costs you $40,000 extra compared to an average guy or $186,000 compared to a top 10% guy.

1) Race




As noted, it costs an extra $247,000 for an Asian man to date a white girl. It costs an extra $154,000 for a black man to date a white girl.

On the other hand, white men can make up to $24,000 less to be considered equally attractive to Asian women. ie. Asian women will accept poor white men over average income Asians.

2) Height



At extremely low male height (eg. 5'0""), height becomes more important than even race, but for more moderate cases of shortness (eg. 5'6""), race is still more important. A 5'6"" man must make an extra $175,000 to match a 5'11"" guy.


3) Face



The maximum cost of facial ugliness is $186,000, and that's for a bottom 10% guy to match a top 10% guy. ie. To bring the ugliest 10% of men up to the performance of the top 10% most handsome men.

4) Money
If we tally up the cost, then we find being an ugly 5'7"" Asian will then cost you an extra $437,000 income per year. ie. You need to make $499,500 annual income to match the attractiveness of an average white guy.

In America, this income represents the top 0.5%.

So the only way money can compensate for being physically unattractive is if you are in the top 0.5%, and this is just enough to bring you back to equal to an average white guy. 

It still isn't enough to make you actually attractive, and you need to find a way to make sure girls know about the money for it to even matter in the first place.

So again, we can see the hierarchy is Race > Height > Face > Money.

Therapists are the capitalist equivalents of KGB informants,Serious,Atavistic Autist,"May 24, 2020",36000,144,"As social alienation has increased due to the dislocations wrought by liberal-capitalism, people have naturally become less capable of resolving disputes between themselves, and so have outsourced conflict resolutions to police officers and therapists and the like.

It is no coincidence that a therapist will not hesitate to call the police on you if you say too much, and betray your trust, because both professions are inherently rooted in the contradictions of a low trust society. Both a police officer and a therapist are ultimately working against you, and see you as something to be managed rather than made satisfied.

A therapist is the capitalist equivalent of a KGB spy in the Soviet Union pretending to be your friend, but who is actually just there to inform on any seditious words of yours, while you pay him to do so (whether through the vector of the state or the sham of paying for ""mental health treatment"").

Except there's much less pretense with a therapist, and at least a KGB spy did not personally force you to remunerate him as he shit-tested your faith in the prevailing system of power."
"""Demoralizing and frightening"": Male feminists, SJWs triggered after incel ""Smooth"" Sanchez avoids federal prison",Based,PPEcel,"Apr 10, 2022",13000,71,"What an amazing week.

Their Twitter followers are similarly upset: ""Great let’s just let him shoot/blow somewhere up like Eliot whatever his name was when the next girl rejects him and he snaps,"" whines @luxeprogressive. ""This is so demoralizing and frightening,"" says @mrsmcglover.

The facts of the case are well-known to many incels.is regulars at this point: Malik ""Smooth"" Sanchez was a self-described incel with a penchant for conducting edgy pranks while livestreaming. In February 2021, then aged 19, Sanchez approached two women who were dining in the outdoor seating area of an NYC restaurant. He then joked about being a suicide bomber: ""Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar. Bomb detonation in two, in two minutes. I take you with me and I kill all you. I kill all you right now. And I kill all you for Allah."" The women and other bystanders fled. This led to his federal prosecution. 

When the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan announced Sanchez's guilty plea in November 2021, Redditors joked about him being “dealt some consequences”; that is, imprisonment and prison rape. SJWs on Twitter cheered when they learned that Sanchez’s offense—false information and hoaxes in violation of 18 U.S.C. §1038(a)(1)—carried a five-year maximum penalty. 

But anyone with even a brief understanding of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines (""U.S.S.G."", ""Guidelines"") would have understood that it was unlikely for Sanchez to receive the statutory maximum. While the Guidelines are not binding, federal judges do impose Guidelines sentences in a wide majority of cases. To calculate the recommended sentence, almost every federal crime in the United States is scored on a point-based system. For example, the base offense level is 43 points for first-degree murder, 32 points for producing child pornography, and 14 points for obstruction of justice (U.S.S.G. §§2A1.1, 2G2.1, 2J1.2 respectively). 

For Sanchez’s bomb hoax, U.S.S.G. §2A6.1(a)(1) places his base offense level at 12 points. But taking into account a 2-point reduction for his guilty plea pursuant to §3E1.1(a), and one prior misdemeanor conviction placing him at Criminal History Category II, the Guidelines place Sanchez's recommended sentence at 8 to 14 months' imprisonment—a far cry from the 60-month maximum. What's more, a recommended sentence of that length is known as a ""Zone B"" sentence; §5C1.1(c)(3) provides that such a sentence could be substituted by home detention, which Sanchez served for nine months between arrest and sentencing. 




Therefore, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon's (pictured here) sentence of time served and supervised release was on the lighter end, but still within the range specified by the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. Though Klee describes Judge McMahon's ruling as a ""sparing precedent"", her sentence was not unreasonably lenient. As retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer pointed out, ""a Guidelines sentence [generally] reflects both the [U.S. Sentencing] Commission’s and the sentencing court’s judgment as to what is an appropriate sentence."" Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338, 351 (2007). On the contrary, it was in fact the U.S. Attorney's Office that sought an unreasonably harsh sentence: incarceration on top of time served, a double punishment. 

When Sanchez was sentenced three days ago, our community celebrated it as a victory for common sense and reason. Klee was dismayed by our celebration:



On the forum incels.is, some users are celebrating his freedom (although he will remain on supervised release for three years), speculating that he played the judge “like a fiddle” by pretending to turn his life around and expressing hope that he starts streaming again.

I don’t know whether @Mecoja is correct about Sanchez playing Judge McMahon “like a fiddle”. As far as I know, Sanchez has never been a member here and I have never interacted with him, so I cannot accurately gauge Sanchez’s personal characteristics. What I do know is that the U.S. Attorney’s Office tried to sell incelophobic hysteria and failed—twice. To that end, Klee takes issue with @SoySupreme 's description of Assistant U.S. Attorney Kaylan Lasky as a “bitch cunt”.



It is undeniable that Lasky (pictured here) adopted a heavy-handed approach against Sanchez throughout the case. In May 2021, she filed a memorandum seeking to deny Sanchez bail in part because he “self-identifies as an Incel”. Stating that her “preliminary assessment” of the U.S.S.G. was that Sanchez would receive a 30- to 37-month prison sentence, she suggested that Sanchez “had an incentive” to flee to Ecuador. Lasky also argued that Sanchez would “threaten or intimidate” witnesses.

We now know that Lasky’s claims were exaggerated. Sanchez’s Guidelines range was not anywhere near 30 to 37 months; it was 8 to 14 months. He did not flee to Ecuador. And as Judge McMahon pointed out at the actual bail hearing, the argument that Sanchez would commit obstruction of justice didn’t hold water—his so-called victims were random strangers. Indeed, Judge McMahon seemed thoroughly annoyed at Lasky: she suspected that the U.S. Attorney’s Office was attempting to overrule the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office comparatively lenient treatment of Sanchez: 


Transcript excerpt of Sanchez's May 6, 2021 bail hearing. 

“Bitch cunt” may be coarse, but under the circumstances, it is apparent that @SoySupreme was critiquing not just Lasky's approach to this case but federal prosecutors as a whole. AUSAs—particularly those in the Southern District of New York—have a well-deserved reputation for aggressiveness, often prioritizing “wins” over the public interest. It’s not a surprise that Lasky’s colleagues in her very unit, Terrorism and International Narcotics, have faced the media spotlight for prosecutorial misconduct in the recent past.









Federal Judge Urges a DOJ Probe of Prosecutorial Conduct in Sanctions Case

Klee’s biggest concern, however, is:



[T]he continued blurriness between the kind of malicious stunts that Sanchez pulled and the premeditation of a real attack...There is, among this crowd and similar toxic communities, a game of walking right up to the line of criminal behavior, such that you can claim it’s all an edgy joke. It always is, until it isn’t.

Click to expand...


There we go. The general thrust of Klee’s article is simply to parrot the oft-repeated far-left talking point that “edginess” by communities they don’t like (e.g. incels) should result in a draconian response from the criminal justice system, because being “edgy” is a gateway to terrorism. They already have a term for it: stochastic “terrorism”. If you accept that absurd supposition, it’s easy to believe that “inciting hate” (i.e. any speech they don’t like) should be criminalized and that “hate speech isn’t free speech” (it is, as far as the First Amendment is concerned). These leftists are not liberals; they are illiberal. 

The irony is that the far-left’s approach to criminal justice is highly selective: If a 19-year-old brown kid commits a hands-on violent offense, say he assaults a police officer during a protest, mugs a commuter, or smashes up a Nordstrom, it’s because he was socioeconomically deprived. He needs mental health counselling, pretrial diversion, and a slap on the wrist from a county judge. But if the same 19-year-old brown kid commits a hands-off offense, physically injuring no one and causing no property damage, it’s time to ask a federal judge to throw the book at him, just because you don’t like some of the words he says on other occasions. The left’s “counter-extremism” rhetoric is nakedly partisan, and it’s right that Lasky’s attempt to serve this moral panic to Judge McMahon faced a frosty reception. A sentencing memorandum in Sanchez’s case should have focused exclusively on Sanchez’s conduct, not Elliot Rodger’s.

Though the “trauma” exhibited by Sanchez’s so-called victims was obviously exaggerated, bomb hoaxes are wrong and they are stupid. They waste valuable time and taxpayer resources. But an incel who commits a crime shouldn’t be punished more harshly than a normie who commits an identical one. In 18 U.S.C. §3553(a)(6), Congress asked federal judges to “avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct”. By sentencing Sanchez to time served, a within-Guidelines sentence (that Klee neglects to mention was recommended by Sanchez’s probation officer), Judge McMahon followed the letter and spirit of the law. 

Alexander Hamilton once noted in Federalist No. 78 that the judiciary “is the best expedient which can be devised in any government, to secure a steady, upright, and impartial administration of the laws.” The reasonable sentence that Sanchez received, despite the braying of an incelophobic mob, is proof that this still rings true, two centuries later.

Study confirms that women care way more about face than body,Blackpill,Enigmatic,"Mar 8, 2018",17000,78,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347207000565

Debunking the “your bad personality is why you can’t get laid” argument once and for all,Blackpill,IncelKing,"Jan 8, 2022",27000,81,"1. Looks are objective, personality is subjective

It has long been debated whether there is an objective, biological basis for the experience of beauty or if it is subjective and individually or culturally driven. To determine this, researchers showed average people images of masterpieces of Classical and Renaissance sculpture, and modified versions of these arts with less mathematically ideal proportions.

They then used fMRI to measure activation of the subjects' brains when they were exposed to either the beautiful ideal art or the less beautiful modified art. Researchers observed clear differential patterns of brain activation. It was shown that average people could easily come to consensus on which version was ""beautiful"" or not, and when beauty was encountered, it activated predictable pathways in the brain to process

Wood (2009) found people agree strongly about the extremes (very attractive and unattractive), but they have diverse tastes about the mid range. For a person with average attractiveness, their ratings generally vary with about 2 standard deviations on a 10-point scale. Hence, the bluepill regarding diversity in preferences holds true for people of average
attractiveness but not for ugly people (and maybe also not for very attractive people).

This is common sense really, if you look at physical features and facial structures of men and women which the opposite sex finds attractive, by analysing the appearance of individuals whose professions require attractive looks in order to succeed (models, actors/actresses etc.) you will find a many commonalities.

Attractive men are typically tall and have trauma-resistant skull structure: square jaw, prominent chin, hunter eye area. Attractive women have more neotonous and feminine features: rounded jaw, small chin.

unlike looks, personality is actually subjective. Everyone is unique and has different interests, hobbies, mindset; philosophy and beliefs. And based on that everyone’s perception of what constitutes a “good personality” will differ from one another, so nobody can make an objective statement and say that “bad personality” is the reasons we incels can’t get laid, there is no such thing as an objectively good or objectively bad personality as the whole concept of personality is subjective.

2. Women tend to be attracted to the Dark Triad—narcissism, manipulativeness, & psychopathy

We’re told to be respectful to women and that our misogyny is preventing women from being attracted to us, but research has confirmed the fact that the phrase “nice guys finish last” is true.

In a study by Carter et al. (2014), 128 women presented with male characters of varying degrees of dark triad personality. Physicality was held constant. Men with dark traits were rated as dramatically more attractive to women compared to control characters who lacked these traits (with >99.9% statistical certainty, p < 0.001).

From an evolutionary standpoint this makes sense. Prior to the formation of civilisations in which women would be given protection from the State, women had to rely on individual males for protection.

the greater a male’s propensity for violence, the more likely he was to win a fight and therefore the more likely he was to prevent a woman from being raped. Therefore violent men were better protectors of women, also violent men were more likely to hoard resources from the men they had killed, thus able to use those resources to provide a more pleasurable life for the woman and her offspring and the greater the chances of survival for the woman and her offspring.

Also, we’re told that we can’t get women because women can just somehow sense our misogyny and get bad “vibes” from us as if they have in-built personality detectors, but if they are so good at being able to read a man’s personality, why do they find themselves in abusive relationships so frequently and so often? This leads us to conclude that not only do women prefer those types of men, but women dont have the magical power to read personality as normies like to claim, otherwise they wouldn’t end up with such men in the first place, they were really with those men because they found those men attractive.

3. Personality is out of your control

this fact is probably the most hard to swallow, but personality is out of your control due to a phenomenon known as the “Halo effect”.

An ugly guy may be confident, extrovertive and outgoing at the beginning. However; because he is ugly women will show no interest in him and nobody will want to include him in their social circles, so eventually after years of bullying and social/sexual rejection he will become shy, quiet and introvertive because of negative re-inforcement due to his looks.

conversely, an attractive guy may be shy, quiet and introvertive to begin with. But men will want to be his friend, women will fight over him and try their best to get his attention, and as a consequence of this positive reinforcement, he will become more confident, outgoing and extrovertive.

so you see, your personality is influenced by how people treat you based on your looks (which is out of your control).

therefore, personality is out of your control.

Judging someone based on personality is really not much better than judging someone on looks. Because at the end of the day, LOOKS = PERSONALITY.

when an ugly guy playfully slaps a females ass, it’s sexual assault and the guy is a rapist. But when an attractive man does it all Of a sudden it’s “flirty” and “kinky”. You see how their personalities are judged differently because of their different looks, even though they are both performing the same action?

How Society is Sociopathic Towards Incels,Blackpill,universallyabhorred,"Dec 23, 2019",27000,88,"Definition: Sociopathy or pscyhopathy is best defined by ASPD(anti-social personality disorder). Key characteristics include inability or very limited ability to feel emotion, callous and disregarding of others, pathological lying for personal gain, manipulation of others for personal gain, inability to feel emotional empathy or very low levels of it etc.


Characteristics Which Apply To Societal Treatment of Incels

Callous and disregarding of our plight:

You see this constantly with statements such as ""just shower"", ""man up"", ""life isn't fair"" or be glad you have food and shelter and aren't some starving guy in Africa. These are intended to dismiss our emotional suffering as unimportant and disregard our pain. They bring up a supposedly greater example that is an unreasonable comparison to paint us as privileged whiners. Meanwhile these same people, who dismiss our pain, have had sex and relationships numerous times within their lives and couldn't live without it, especially women. Even those starving guys in Africa have had more emotional and physical intimacy in their lives than we ever will.

 Constant lying with bluepilled platitudes and sugar-coating the issue

This is displayed through claims such as ""if you do x, y and z you will get laid no matter how you look"" or ideas such as ""looks don't matter, it's all about personality."" Most people know these are lies and the issue is much more complex, yet by making up these lies, they profit off the time and effort of unattractive incels.

Some of this profit is quite direct such as through PUA scammers, who sell the lie that approaching women in a certain way will lead to sex and relationships, incels pay thousands for these bootcamps and end up with no results. The other way they gain from this is by keeping these men oblivious they will continue to contribute to society, through working necessary jobs to provide services, manufacture goods, maintain infrastructure, construct and design stuff or engage in innovative research. They further benefit from the taxes they pay to keep society running and benefit already privileged groups such as single mothers.

 Manipulation through gaslighting, scapegoating and media misrepresentation of the incel perspective

Gaslighting involves making a victim doubt their own perceptions, this is done by claiming that the incel blackpill ideology is delusional, toxic, or evil. They often suggest brainwashing through therapy and medication to incels in doubt which does nothing to change our situation and can at best turn us into brain dead zombies coasting numbly through life.

Scapegoating involves blaming someone for things they are not the cause of, incels are blamed for being unable to get sex or relationships with women, our personality, attitudes, ideology or dislike of women is blamed, instead of genetic factors beyond our control which is the cause. They often mix up cause and effect, claiming we are incel because of being hateful instead of becoming hateful due to being forced into celibacy.

Media also constantly misrepresents us, grouping us with those who are already hated, such as pedophiles, Nazis, Alt-Right or misogynists. They display our issue as one of hatred and wanting to enslave women rather than being rejected for our looks and rightfully feeling resentful and angry about it. They have never disproven the blackpill or any of our concepts and cannot argue logicallyl resulting in them using the ad hominem fallacy instead.

These are purposeful forms of manipulation to make incels doubt themselves, feel ashamed of ourselves, vilify incels to the general public to prevent other oppressed men from joining us and prevent us from publicly discussing our oppression. All of these are engaged to continue to oppress and torture incels, while other groups associated with SJW's are not only given basic rights but special privileges, which make their lives easier.

 Inability to feel empathy towards incels

Since most of these people cannot imagine living the incel life, we have low status and poor rap , they feel absolutely no empathy for our suffering at all. As such ideas such as exterminating us, bullying us, ridiculing us or driving us to suicide seem appealing to the majority of people. This is especially seen through SJW types such as IT, who seek to destroy and humiliate us. We are the new boogeyman whom everyone wants to eliminate."
Free speech and pro-rape viewpoints: Redditors prove yet again that they are constitutionally illiterate,Discussion,PPEcel,"Jan 3, 2022",12000,90,"Some Discordcel alerted me to the following CuckTears post from two weeks ago, where a few former .is members discussed rape and vigilantism on a separate forum.


Spoiler




View: https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTear/comments/rkz3cg/so_incels_wish_death_rape_and_torture_upon_women/




First of all, let me say that JosefMengelecel is not someone I like. He was banned from .is several months ago, and rightly so. But the requirements of the First Amendment are crystal clear. The FBI cannot arrest him for writing this:




Nevertheless, soycucks started screeching:



Oh, man. With every new post, their ignorance plumbs new depths.



Dissecting JosefMengelecel's speech

It's certainly a bizarre monologue. But JosefMengelecel never directed any person to commit illegal activity. Nor did he say that he was going to commit illegal activity. Depending on the specificity and context of said speech, the former would possibly be ""incitement"", the latter would possibly be a ""true threat""; but his speech falls in neither category.

Rather, JosefMengelecel abstractly suggests that ""rape should be properly legalized"", and that rape victims and their ""cuck[ed]"" relatives should be ""publicly tortured"" should rapists be harmed. Here, he is merely engaging in political speech, expressing his viewpoint on a public policy issue. His viewpoint is that governments should not criminalize rape, but should instead protect the physical safety of rapists, and cruelly punish those who harm rapists.

Applying the First Amendment to JosefMengelecel's speech



JosefMengelecel's viewpoint is certainly unconventional. But the First and Fourteenth Amendments prevent the FBI from arresting him for expressing it. It is his fundamental right to express this viewpoint. This is not a legally contested issue; this has been clearly established for a few decades now.

Generally speaking, constitutional law classifies government actions regulating speech as either ""content-neutral"" regulations (i.e. the time, place, and manner of speech) or ""content-based"" regulations (i.e. what can and cannot be said). The latter is held to a higher degree of, or ""strict"", scrutiny. A subgroup of content-based regulation is viewpoint-based regulation, where the government discriminates against speakers based on the specific perspective of their speech.

Because, as the Supreme Court stated thusly, ""Giving offense is a viewpoint,"" Matal v. Tam 137 S. Ct. 1744, 1763 (2017), the most important takeaway from case law addressing viewpoint-based regulation is that the First Amendment equally protects unpopular or even hateful speech as it protects socially desirable speech.

To say that the judiciary is extremely skeptical of viewpoint discrimination would be an understatement. Generally, the government is not allowed to ""impose special prohibitions on those speakers who express views on disfavored subjects,"" R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 391 (1992). “If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.” Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 414 (1989) (Holding that the First Amendment protects the right to burn the U.S. flag.) ""[W]e have indicated that in public debate our own citizens must tolerate insulting, and even outrageous speech in order to provide adequate breathing space to the freedoms protected by the First Amendment."" Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network, 519 U.S. 357, 373 (1997) (Quoting Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 322 (1988); internal quotations omitted).

Any reasonable person who understands First Amendment jurisprudence consequently recognizes that Josefmengelecel has every right to express his opinion that rape should be decriminalized; just as a Redditor has the same right to express its opinion that alleged rapists should be publicly executed without a trial. On a similar note, a meme that says ""I support beating the shit out of pedophiles"" is not entitled to greater constitutional protection compared to a hypothetical meme that says ""I support beating the shit out of feminists."" The unpopularity or offensiveness of the ideas being expressed is irrelevant.

""But what about social justice and m'lady?""



The most prevalent (yet unsound) argument proffered by normies on the question of ""misogyny"" is that:

P1) ""Hateful"" speech is harmful to femoids; and
P2) The government has a compelling interest to prevent harm;
C) Therefore, the FBI should suppress ""hateful"" speech and arrest you silly inkwells!

But the U.S. Constitution's answer is clear: No. The government is generally not permitted to redistribute the social costs of ""harmful"" speech from a listener to a speaker by punishing the speaker.

The FBI isn't a cabal of moral philosophers tasked to strike a normatively desirable balance between a misguided understanding of ""social justice"" and incels' civil liberties; they're a law enforcement agency tasked to enforce the law as it is written. And though the law excepts certain ""well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech"" Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 571 (1942), from First Amendment protection, none of those categories applies to JosefMengelecel's political speech.

[STUDY] Social isolation increases mortality by up to 50% and is as bad as smoking 15 cigarettes per day (5 STUDIES),Brutal,Gymcelled,"Aug 30, 2020",23000,143,"So I have several studies here to show. The links to the studies are found at the end of this post

Study number 1: Not being lonely reduces your mortality rate by 50%, far exceeding many other health factors

Data across 308,849 individuals, followed for an average of 7.5 years, indicate that individuals with adequate social relationships have a 50% greater likelihood of survival compared to those with poor or insufficient social relationships. The magnitude of this effect is comparable with quitting smoking and it exceeds many well-known risk factors for mortality (e.g., obesity, physical inactivity).

The overall effect remained consistent across a number of factors, including age, sex, initial health status, follow-up period, and cause of death, suggesting that the association between social relationships and mortality may be general, and efforts to reduce risk should not be isolated to subgroups such as the elderly.

To draw a parallel, many decades ago high mortality rates were observed among infants in custodial care (i.e., orphanages), even when controlling for pre-existing health conditions and medical treatment [201]–[204]. Lack of human contact predicted mortality. The medical profession was stunned to learn that infants would die without social interaction. This single finding, so simplistic in hindsight, was responsible for changes in practice and policy that markedly decreased mortality rates in custodial care settings. Contemporary medicine could similarly benefit from acknowledging the data: Social relationships influence the health outcomes of adults. 


Study number 2: Loneliness is bad for your health, increases mortality by 26% on average, going up to 48% for the top quintile of isolation

The sample size was 6500 people, all over the age of 52. (after all normies only care about the isolation of old people or just pretend like only old people suffer from that)




Socially isolated individuals are at increased risk for the development of cardiovascular disease (3), infectious illness (4), cognitive deterioration (5), and mortality (6⇓⇓–9). Social isolation also has been associated with elevated blood pressure, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen (10, 11) and with heightened inflammatory and metabolic responses to stress (12, 13).
[...]
Loneliness itself has been linked with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality (15⇓⇓–18), elevated blood pressure and cortisol (19⇓–21), heightened inflammatory responses to stress (22, 23), and modifications in transcriptional pathways linked with glucocorticoid and inflammatory processes (24).

after adjusting statistically for demographic factors and baseline health, social isolation remained significantly associated with mortality (hazard ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.48 for the top quintile of isolation)

Study number 3: Social isolation is as powerful as other classical health factors such as high blood pressure and smoking

Sample size: Almost 17 000. More of the same, I won't be copypasting much, the graphs in the study are really nice.




Results. Socially isolated men and women had worse unadjusted survival curves than less socially isolated individuals. Cox models revealed that social isolation predicted mortality for both genders, as did smoking and high blood pressure.

If anyone can find the study it would be cool. I do have a link to an official pdf from the AARP that mentions this fact on page 3

According to a study published last year in Perspectives on Psychological Science, the health effects of prolonged isolation are equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. [broken link]


Study number 5: Loneliness could be considered a disease based on the consequences it has on human health

Loneliness may be pathognomic of depression in old age. It is reported to be more dangerous than smoking[1]; high degree of loneliness precipitates suicidal ideation and para-suicide,[2] Alzheimer's disease, and other dementia[3,4] and adversely affects the immune and cardio-vascular system.[5] It is a generally accepted opinion that loneliness results in a decline of well-being and has an adverse effect on physical health, possibly through immunologic impairment or neuro-endocrine changes.[6] Loneliness is thus, among the latent causes of hospitalization and of placement in nursing homes.[7] 

Loneliness predisposes a person to physical diseases too as it has an adverse impact on immune, cardiovascular, and endocrine system.[32] Consistent, overwhelming and pervasive loneliness develops stress and ultimately culminates into serious physical disease. Feeling of loneliness and being alone were found to be independent predictors of motor decline in old age.[33] Loneliness was also found to be an independent predictor of mortality and functional decline after controlling for depression.[34] It also leads to memory impairment and learning difficulties, and makes the person prone to Alzheimer's disease.[35] A Dutch study reports that people who feel lonely are more likely to develop clinical dementia over a period of 3 years compared to those who do not experience loneliness.[36] 

Study 5 also delves into the differences between loneliness and solitude, risk factors of social isolation etc. It's a decent read. Though they quote a study that said that women are more socially isolated than men jfl. It's in india though so who knows

Blackpill 101 Infographics,Blackpill,Kokoro,"Jun 20, 2018",27000,99,This is the thread that I will be posting these from now on. Feel free to share these also don't be afraid to suggest things I can add.
Brainscans show that people feel no empathy for the social pain of others + Social pain activates the same parts of the brain as physical pain,Blackpill,Gymcelled,"May 2, 2021",13000,85,"You see it all the time: some lonely male dares to briefly vent or complain online about how miserable his life is and everyone acts completely apathetic if not straight up aggressive. People will constantly downplay everything he's going through. Psychiatrists will just be confused and tell him nothing’s wrong with him, everything is in his head, that he can totally live with the issues he's having.

TURNS OUT MAYBE THEY SIMPLY CANNOT CARE ON A NEUROLOGICAL LEVEL

Brain scans show that social pain is real and activates the very same parts of the brain as physical pain
This corroborates a previous study found on the wiki
Unlike physical pain, the social pain of others did NOT activate the parts of the brain that would suggest feelings of empathy
The only exception to this was with close friends, only then did people show brain activation that suggests empathy
Moreover, reliving social pain is much more painful that reliving physical pain. 
SOCIAL PAIN HAUNTS YOU
Social exclusion INCREASES sensitivity to physical pain, social support DECREASES it. Physical and social pain are both real and they overlap, there is a shared pain circuitry 

People don't care about the social hardships you go through. People will have 1000 times more empathy for a guy getting suckerpunched on worldstarthiphop than they’ll have for a social outcast and lifelong victim. It's pointless to expect sympathy/empathy from other people, don't waste your time pouring your heart out and expecting them to understand

People don’t care because they CANNOT care 

Unless maybe they deeply love you to begin with 






Social pain haunts you 





""With regard to reliving pain, studies have shown that reliving socially painful experiences elicits more pain. Thus, subjects reported feeling more pain after reliving a prior episode of social pain than after reliving a prior episode of physical pain, even though there were no differences in the amount of pain experienced at the time the event originally occurred (‘initial pain’, see the figure, part a)""

People don't have empathy for the social pain of others





""Interestingly, when it comes to observing the pain of others (empathy), the reverse pattern is observed. When observing others in physical pain, participants show increased activity in affective pain-related neural regions, such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the anterior insula (AI) (dACC activation shown in part b of the figure), whereas these same neural responses are not present when observing others in social pain (mentalizing regions, such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, are present instead; see part c of the figure), unless the target of the social pain is a close friend (see part d of the figure)""



Spoiler: The authors trying to explain this phenomenon, read more if you're curious



Interestingly, when it comes to observing the pain of others (empathy), the reverse pattern is observed. When observing others in physical pain, participants show increased activity in affective pain-related neural regions, such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the anterior insula (AI) (dACC activation shown in part b of the figure), whereas these same neural responses are not present when observing others in social pain (mentalizing regions, such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, are present instead; see part c of the figure), unless the target of the social pain is a close friend (see part d of the figure)



Physical-social pain overlap: being a loner/outcast will physically hurt you









""Experimental manipulations of failure (which may convey that one would not be liked or accepted by others) have been shown to increase pain ratings to a cold-pressor task, a painful task that involves immersing one’s hand in ice water for extended periods of time. Similarly, experiences of social exclusion have been shown to increase physical pain sensitivity, and those who report feeling more rejected in response to exclusion report higher physical pain ratings in response to a pain stimulus delivered at the end of the exclusion episode.""

""In addition to pain-enhancing effects, factors that reduce one type of painful experience should reduce the other as well. Along these lines, considerable research has shown that social support, typically associated with reduced perceptions of social harm, is related to reduced physical pain. Correlational research has demonstrated that individuals with more social support experience less pain across a number of different domains. 
In addition, experimental work has demonstrated a causal effect of social support on pain. For example, viewing a picture or holding the hand of a loved one (relative to a stranger or object) leads to reductions in self-reported pain, as well as reductions in pain-related neural activity (in the dACC and AI). Thus, the perception or presence of social support, presumably indicative of a lesser likelihood of social harm, appears to reduce physical pain as well.""

[STUDY] Make-up tricks men by faking signals of sexual arousal and fertility – Science of cosmetics (6 studies),Blackpill,Gymcelled,"Feb 24, 2021",16000,59,"I find it laughable that in a word where simply touching a woman’s arm can get you in jail, women are broadcasting signals of “I’m horny and fertile” all day every day.

All forms of media bombard us with sex constantly, porn has never been more easily accessible/widespread and with Onlyfans we’ve reached a point where it’s increasingly more common for normal women to objectify themselves like never before. If that’s not enough we basically have virtually all women walking around daily with their faces painted in a way that suggests that they’re sexually aroused and ready to conceive.

The average male is basically teased and blueballed daily. And yet he’s gaslighted and guilt tripped into being an asexual high inhib drone, as one misstep could destroy his life and reputation.

Disclaimer for the bluepillers lurking: No, this post isn’t in any way implying or condoning rape, don’t bother screenshotting this and reposting it while trying to put words in my mouth. I just find it disturbing how extremely sexualized society has become yet men walk around on eggshells, just asking a co-worker out gets you fired by HR or cancelled on social media

Disclaimer 2: Yes make up has other roles such as hiding imperfections and promoting a healthy look. Imperfections could also tie into youth and fertility as younger people have far less facial and cutaneous imperfections in general. A healthy look directly ties into fertility


a) Lip color signals sexual arousal and fertility/ovulation => Lip stick

Lip colour affects perceived sex typicality and attractiveness of human faces 

""The association between lip colour contrast and attractiveness in women's faces may be attributable to its association with oxygenated blood perfusion indicating oestrogen levels, sexual arousal, and cardiac and respiratory health.""


 Notice how besides the health factors, red lips indicate SEXUAL AROUSAL and HIGH ESTROGEN. When do women hit their peak estrogen? Right around the time of ovulation.

Women are getting men to pay more attention to them with make up by feigning sexual desires and ovulation/high fertility.

“I’m horny and fertile”

b) Ovulation makes women more attractive (ties into the previous point)
Female facial attractiveness increases during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle​
“While human ovulation is clearly not advertised to the same extent as in some other species, we show here that both men and women judge photographs of women's faces that were taken in the fertile window of the menstrual cycle as more attractive than photographs taken during the luteal phase. This indicates the existence of visible cues to ovulation in the human face, and is consistent with similar cyclical changes observed for preferences of female body odour. This heightened allure could be an adaptive mechanism for raising a female's relative value in the mating market at the time in the cycle when the probability of conception is at its highest.”

 While this doesn’t address make up specifically, this shows that men do indeed find ovulating women more attractive. So masquerading as a woman who's ovulating via make up should indeed have an effect on men.

c) Red cheeks/flushing are a signal of sexual arousal => Blush cosmetics (aka ""Rouge"")
Sex flushes: Thermal and color changes in face during sexual arousal​
 Flushing (ie cheeks becoming red) can be caused by arousal and is not only measurable but also noticeable by people

“Our exploratory study showed that all experimental situations triggered temperature and color changes in face. Changes in redness were visible and therefore can serve as a signal for recognizing of emotional state and sexual arousal of communication partner.”

The same results are found in the next study

A Sex Difference in Facial Contrast and its Exaggeration by Cosmetics​“This study demonstrates the existence of a sex difference in facial contrast. By measuring carefully controlled photographic images, female faces were shown to have greater luminance contrast between the eyes, lips, and the surrounding skin than did male faces. This sex difference in facial contrast was found to influence the perception of facial gender. An androgynous face can be made to appear female by increasing the facial contrast, or to appear male by decreasing the facial contrast. Application of cosmetics was found to consistently increase facial contrast. Female faces wearing cosmetics had greater facial contrast than the same faces not wearing cosmetics. Female facial beauty is known to be closely linked to sex differences, with femininity considered attractive. These results suggest that cosmetics may function in part by exaggerating a sexually dimorphic attribute—facial contrast—to make the face appear more feminine and hence attractive.”

d) Darker eye areas signal high estrogen and fertility => eye make up/mascara 
Sex, Beauty, and the Relative Luminance of Facial Features​tl;dr darker eye areas (as well as more colorful lips, like we discussed earlier) are a feminine trait found in high estrogen women. By darkening their eye area, women are making themselves look more feminine, more estrogenic and thus more fertile looking.

“An interpretation consistent with these results is that the luminance difference between the eyes and mouth and the rest of the face is naturally greater in women than men. In this case increasing or decreasing the luminance difference will make a face more feminine or masculine, respectively, and hence, more or less attractive depending on the sex of the face. Implications for the causes of cosmetics usage are discussed.

e) Homogeneous skin tones signal youth and fertility => Foundation make up
Color homogeneity and visual perception of age, health, and attractiveness of female facial skin​Younger looking => more fertile looking

“I’m fertile teehee”

“Homogeneity of unprocessed images correlated positively with perceived attractiveness, healthiness, and youthfulness (all r > 0.40; P < .001), but negatively with estimated age (r = -0.45; P < .001).”

 This is interesting but from what I've read they don't really have a clear explanation as for why this is the case

 I have a hypothesis which i will back up with studies:

In studies in which cortisol was assayed either in saliva or in urine, significant decreases were noted in cortisol levels (averaging decreases 31%). In studies in which the activating neurotransmitters (serotonin and dopamine) were assayed in urine, an average increase of 28% was noted for serotonin and an average increase of 31% was noted for dopamine.

 The decrease in cortisol and increase in dopamine are already interesting but it is the serotonin increase that interests me the most

Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that is associated with relaxation, positivity, a sense of feeling good etc. It's the happiness drug of our body.
That alone sounds like it would help you sleep right? Well it gets better: serotonin is a precursor of melatonin, the hormone of sleep (see pic below)

 Melatonin regulates our circadian rythm (the body's internal clock in layman's terms) and it is the key to good sleep. Melatonin is often used to treat sleep disorders or to promote a better sleep. I've put 2 studies on melatonin in the spoiler if you're interested

"Our Blackpill Future: lurkers from incels.is, inceltear, and incelexit, I need your help.",Theory,Sufficiently-Large7,"May 4, 2022",6000,15,"Reddit won’t let me post this because the moderators insta-delete posts about short men unless it paints us in a bad light to maintain the narrative that short men are evil, so as a last resort I’m posting here because I don’t think this site will censor this, plus, I am an incel and this post strongly involves incel matters. I’m a manlet after all. I’ve added more to the post since it won't be subject to removal by the thought police.

I know people don’t like to hear things like this but I genuinely feel as if most people treat me as lesser because of my height. 

Every time I meet a new person I know they’re inevitably going to bring up or try to dunk on my height or blatantly insult me. I want to be a happy man and to be able to connect with those I interact with, but it seems like no one will ever allow me this option. They can only ever see me as a “short guy.” At my workplace everyone makes jokes straight to my face, calling me “little guy” or asking if I need help reaching stuff with a smirk on their face. I always just smile or say nothing because I have no idea how to react. Short women can attest, people can be so condescending, to the point of being treated like a child. It’s even worse for men of course because men are expected to be tall. 

I feel like this is why so many short guys appear so cold or rude. Every single person that I meet feels the need to put me down for something I have no control over. It’s just my appearance, my genetics. I feel as if I’m a human being who has been reduced to a number and a set of stereotypes. Actually I don’t feel like a human being at all. 

Judging from social media, movies and tv, my own experiences, and dating apps it almost seems as if a man’s entire value can be wholly condensed down into one measurement: his height. Imagine if women were reduced (dehumanized and objectified) in a similar way by means of BMI or waist circumference. If it were a common occurrence for this conversation to take place: 

Woman: Hello, you’re very handsome! 

Man: Hi. What is your BMI? 

Woman: Oh, it’s 26 . 

Man: I only date women with a BMI under 25 and a waist circumference of 35 inches. Sorry, It’s just a preference. Bye bye. 

And if many men had that criteria in their bios as well…, if men acted like women do, there would be riots in the streets. There would be an entire movement propped up to end this from happening. It would be done under the guise of ""body positivity"" and ""feminism."" But when done to men ""It's just a preference (societal beauty standard) teehee!"" I know I'm correct because they literally did this with fat women, not that I have a problem with that really. But you can't have your cake and eat it too. You can't claim body positivity for women but advocate for denigrating and dehumanizing men for not being the height you want us to be. If so you're hypocrites. 

Men have preferences. Women have standards. I repeat. Men have preferences. Women have standards. Having small boobs or being chubby or some other “flaw” doesn’t doom you to a life of being alone. A life without love. For men, the only time anything else like values, merits, beliefs, or personality are taken into account is when you meet the minimum height requirement. Yes personality matters, but you must be this tall to ride.

Height acts like a hierarchy, a modern-day technologically enforced caste system for men and the higher you are in that hierarchy the better people treat you, the more women like you, the more respect you receive, and the more money you make. If you’re at the bottom of the hierarchy, just like being ugly, people will shit on you mercilessly, and society will applaud because they'll always find some virtuous justification. There’s a reason short men have such a high suicide rate, in a group that is already at a high risk of suicide (men). It doesn’t feel good to be a short man, and other people really like to exploit those feelings, from my experiences and from the data. People love reminding me that my body just isn’t acceptable. 

The pinned post of r/short is literally a suicide warning because their members are prone to committing fucking SUICIDE. Hello? This is sick. Does anyone else not see this? Remove the moderation and it immediately becomes a cesspool. Because being a short man is T E R R I B L E. Meanwhile r/tall engages in their 50th self-masurbatory thread of the week, with constant comments also insulting short men, just for good measure. Because we need to know how hated we are by these people. We must know how disgusting we are. 

Look at this article which I’m sure you’ve already seen: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/articl...lengthening-surgery-height-stigma-short-kings

Society is pressuring men into getting expensive, dangerous surgery just to gain some semblance of respect. Some semblance of basic human decency from those around us. This rhetoric spouted by society has real-world consequences. Men shattering their fucking legs and running balls-deep into excruciating pain just so that they are less hated by those around them. 

Based on statistics and just looking around, I know this isn’t all in my head. I think many other young men are feeling this same way and that doesn’t seem reflective of a society that is healthy. Look at all those tiktoks. Look at the stereotypes society has made for us. Napoleon complex this and short man syndrome that. There are women who have gained millions of followers just because they insult men for being short or bald or ugly (Drew Afualo). They can try to hide behind a veil of “combating misogyny” but it all comes down to being a fucking bully, and reminding undesirable men just how much we are hated. I don’t think having so many incels is healthy. Look at where you we now, some subreddit or website literally dedicated to this stuff and to either discuss this societal phenomenon or to insult those of us who don’t have societally-approved genetic material. At this point r/inceltear is just r/uglyandshortmanhate but they pretend to be virtuous to stroke their own egos. At least incels don't pretend to be beacons of morality and shows of great personality like these cringe ass redditors do. Condescending NPCs with not a single original thought. Each one of their opinions mass produced and societally approved. Just regurgitating shit from their echo chambers. The instinctual hatred of ""incels"" and short men is really just bullying that they try to justify with stereotypes and strawmen arguments. Back in school they bullied outright but now they need all these systems of thought to keep their conscious squeaky clean. Hatred is always rationalized and justified. Why do you think the ""short man syndrome"" stereotype was created? As a justification for hatred but these fucking sheep can't see they're being lead by wolves. Inceltear of course would never post this paragraph right here because they need to paint all incels as whatever they decide so they can continue their bullying and masturbation. They are cowards and cherrypick posts from here. If they ever read these words they would call me a napoleon short man syndrome manlet or whatever as per usual or they would purposefully misinterpret what I'm saying (deception) and strawman my words so they can make some weak ass smug rebuttal (cowardice). News to you: Anyone can cherrypick any group to make them look bad. It's not hard and it's not an achievement. Here I'll do it myself. 
Look at this thread and comment from inceltears: 
View: https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTear/comments/ubhb6b/everyone_presenting_you_the_worst_brand_of_incels/i64uxsf/?utm_term=39553041039&context=3&utm_medium=comment_embed&utm_source=embed&utm_name=

Mask completely off. Just blatant racism. ""The worst brand of incels are Indian incels"" LMAO. According to this commenter Men judge women for their actions and that is unacceptable but women judge men for their genetics and that's a-ok. This is where we are now. 
""Incels: Women exist to be breeding cows. It’s okay to judge them if they drink or smoke and by the clothes she wears.
Women: You’re not tall enough for me and you have skinny wrists. I don’t want my children to be weak and deformed.
Incels: YOU JUDGMENTAL BITCHES HOW DARE YOU""
12 upvotes for this trash. Short men are ""deformed"" to them. Mask off. These hypocrites claim that Incels are racist and sexist? But so are they. The only difference is that they'll try to hide away from that fact using deception and out of cowardice. They are obsessed with witch-hunting in order to make themselves seem virtuous. It's the same deal with cancel-culture on twitter. Ages ago these people would've been burning witches. Nothing they say has any substance or value because they are not individuals but rather members of a hivemind. You can't speak to these people like you would a human because there's nothing there. Look up the term, ""oversocialization."" Coined by a reprehensible fellow but he was very correct in predicting that. Incels are shit but at least they're humans and not a monolithic collective. Incels genuinely argue over shit amongst themselves while these inceltears engage in their little circlejerk. 

I’ve never had a girlfriend, and how can I gain the confidence to approach women when everyone talks about how ugly and undesirable I am? When everyone thinks I’m bad? When I just get rejected over and over? I’ve asked out 4 women in my life and obviously they all have rejected me for being short. 3 of them outright stated this fact. I’m 5’1’’. Redditors will say it's my personality when murderers and serial killers get love letters from prison for being good looking. 

Reddit seems to be vitriolic when it comes to this subject, and I know I will never get any replies without their mask of arrogance, deception, and gaslighting that are genuinely interested in having a conversation with me instead of painting me as some sort of monster. From one human being to another, don’t you think this is wrong? I want to be happy. I don’t know how to escape this trap and no one else seems to have a good answer. I need help. Ironically incels seem much more accepting than “normal” people when it comes to this. Is it such a crime to want to seek love? If you were never in a relationship wouldn't you want to be in one? Held by someone you love? Sex isn't everything and yet you have it all the time? You have consistent relationships. It's like a rich man telling a poor man that money isn't everything. My standards are not high and no incels standards are high, we're incels. I don't care about your weight or whatever else. Is it such a crime for a mf to want to be loved? Does that make me so evil? 

Every single reddit post that discusses this societal problem just has everyone piling onto the short guy who made the post. Casting the blame onto him and making some snide height joke for good measure. The advice is to become insanely rich or to waste away forever. 

Seriously, what do I do? Am I blackpilled? Do I just accept that everyone hates me and live a life of solitude? What. The. Fuck. Am. I. To. Do? I am genuinely asking. Is there not one person on Earth that can give me advice worth a shit? Is everyone just stupid? 

Regardless, if society keeps telling young men that all we are is our height and looks, if society continues the dehumanization and objectification of men, my “blackpill” present is your blackpill future. Fix the problem or bear the consequences. Men and women are more than our looks and height and weight and whatever the fuck else you pull out of your hat. Goodbye, and fuck you. I would say to suck my dick, but I suppose I would need to be taller for you to consider. Yes I am mad. I have a right to be. Anyone saying otherwise is arguing in bad faith. I am a human being. I am not a monster. I will not give you the power to make me one, because then you win. You want all short men to be evil so that you are justified in your hatred. The hatred comes first, remember that. I came home crying my first day of kindergarten, because the other children were already bullying the fuck out of me for being a small male. Did I have a napoleon complex back then? As an innocent 4 year old little child who just wanted to make friends? Did I you pieces of fucking shit? I never wanted any of this. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I wish you didn’t hate me. Don’t think yourself as morally superior, you could’ve been in my situation just as easily. You were born with different genetics that society doesn’t hate you for. That’s why you’re not an incel, that’s why you’re not a “bitter short guy”, not because you’re morally superior. It’s because you’re more attractive in the eyes of society. You criticize our personality while sitting on the inceltears subreddit all day making fun of men that need help. Men in terrible circumstances. Watching us like zoo animals. You don’t understand how depraved and terrible this all is because you’ve completely entrenched yourself in this degeneracy. A baby without touch dies. Humans are social animals. You’re cruel and enjoy seeing others suffer. I don’t owe you a dazzling smile while you kick me in the ribs. We're all so disconnected and lonely and this is why incels exist. This is why the hikikomori exist. Men are treated like GARBAGE. This is why the birthrate is shit. Antidepressant use and autism and microplastics and climate change it just gets more fucked and fucked and fucked. The economy will fall. The metaverse is being built as we speak. You'll own nothing and be happy. War has already started. When society burns I’ll sit atop the ashes and tell you I told you so. Maybe this world is better than I think and I won’t have to.

"Analysis: U.S. Secret Service publishes report on Tallahassee Hot Yoga shooting and ""misogynist extremism""",Discussion,PPEcel,"Mar 16, 2022",9000,77,"Earlier this week, the National Threat Assessment Center (NTAC), the social science research component of the U.S. Secret Service, released a case study highlighting Scott Beierle’s 2018 shooting of a yoga studio. I highly recommend reading it here.

This is not the first NTAC report I have referenced on incels.is. Shortly after the high school shooting in Oxford, Michigan last year, I wrote about NTAC’s research on school shootings; they concluded that well over two-thirds of American K-12 school shooters were bullied. You can read that thread here:








U.S. Secret Service: 80% of school attackers were victims of bullying (and a subsequent discussion)


In light of recent events, I decided to reread the National Threat Assessment Center's (NTAC) 2019 report, Protecting America’s Schools: A U.S. Secret Service Analysis of Targeted School Violence. This was a comprehensive analysis of 41 incidents of targeted school violence at K-12 schools from...

I have also reviewed portions of a Tallahassee Police Department supplemental field case report on Beierle.

The shooting




On November 2nd, 2018, 40-year-old Scott Beierle walked into a Florida yoga studio at 5:17 pm. He signed up for the 5:30 pm class and asked an employee when the more crowded classes were held, seemingly disappointed that relatively few people had registered for the class. After pacing around for several minutes, he joined the class at 5:29 pm. At 5:35 pm, Beierle then put on hearing protection, pulled out a 9mm Glock 17 and shot six individuals. His gun jammed; when he cleared it, he then turned the gun on himself.



Of the six individuals Beierle shot, two of them later died (pictured here). The medical examiner indicated that Maura Binkley, 21, died from a single gunshot wound in the back of her head. Nancy Van Vessem, 61, died from two gunshot wounds: one which entered through her lower back area; the other which entered her left rear shoulder blade area.

The life of “Yogacel”

Scott Beierle grew up in upstate New York. In high school, he was disciplined for groping a female classmate after she declined his invitation to go to a school dance. After the 2018 shooting, a former classmate came forward to say that he had regularly stalked her during their time in high school. In college, Beierle was fired from his part-time job at an insurance call center for harassing a coworker and stalking her at the gym. Law enforcement was involved, but the coworker declined to press charges. He also harassed a classmate at his university; she reported him to school officials, who simply told Beierle to leave her alone. Throughout this time, he had few friendships and no romantic relationships.

After graduation, Beierle found work as a public school teacher in Maryland. Soon after, he was investigated by the county police department after a female high school student reported that he had touched her arm, asked if she would pose in Playboy, and suggested that she wear low-cut shirts. The case was not fully investigated and he taught at the school for another year. Throughout this time period, Beierle also encountered similar issues with his family. Beierle was once kicked out of his niece’s birthday party after other parents complained that he was inappropriately touching the backsides of girls as he helped them from a waterslide. On another occasion, Beierle was caught entering his sister-in-law’s bedroom and standing over her as she slept.



After he left teaching in Maryland, Beierle joined the United States Army in 2008 and was commissioned as an officer. He was assigned to the 1st Armored Division, then operating at the U.S. Army Garrison Ansbach in Germany. The following year, four enlisted women complained about his behaviour. Beierle was not recommended for promotion to first lieutenant; instead, the Army determined that Beierle was guilty of “conduct unbecoming an officer” and “fraternizing with an enlisted person”. He was honorably discharged in 2010 for unacceptable conduct.

In 2011, Beierle enrolled in graduate school at Florida State University. There, he spooked his roommates with his behavior. His roommates, assuming that Beierle suffered from PTSD, compared him to Ted Bundy and would not leave any of their guests alone with him. He was then arrested by police for battery after groping two women at the FSU dining hall. Though the charges were later dropped for lack of evidence, he remained permanently banned from the dining hall. One year after Beierle graduated from FSU, he was reported by a campus employee for following a female volleyball coach multiple times; he was arrested for misdemeanor trespassing, but the charges were dropped after he completed a diversion program. He was banned from campus entirely.

Starting from 2015, Beierle was hired as a substitute teacher for a Florida school district. He had failed the Florida Teacher Certification Examination, and the teachers who interviewed him were so concerned by his erratic behavior that they locked the door after he left the interview. He was hired anyway: the following year, Beierle was fired for conducting online searches for pornography involving yoga and cheerleaders during work, on work devices. Soon after he was fired from substitute teaching, Beierle was arrested and charged with battery for slapping, grabbing, and shaking the backside of a woman who was sunbathing next to a pool at their apartment complex in Tallahassee. The charges were dropped after he completed court-mandated sex addiction therapy. Nevertheless, he was evicted. Beierle moved to Deltona, Florida, where he lived with his landlord until the 2018 shooting. Beierle’s family would later say that Beierle spoke highly of his landlord, who regularly bought Beierle clothes and food out of concern.

In 2017, Beierle found employment as a full-time middle school teacher. Three sisters who attended the school said he made them feel uncomfortable, that he would stare at female but not male students. Although he was fired after two weeks for classroom performance issues, he was allowed to continue work in the district as a substitute teacher. After the attack, his former students would describe him as someone who gave a “psychopath vibe” and was “really creepy”. In May 2018, he was fired after asking a female middle school student if she was ticklish and touching her stomach.

From the mid-2010s up to the shooting, Beierle regularly sought and attended dates with women; all ended in failure. He also composed and uploaded music that others would later describe contained “red flags”: lyrics included, for example, “blow off the head of a cunt”. He revered Elliot Rodger, the 2014 Isla Vista shooter.

Beierle also regularly recorded videos where he shared his thoughts on women, racial minorities, and politics, for example:


Spoiler: Video




View: https://vimeo.com/689081677



On the day of the shooting, he left the following two notes in a hotel room:



“If I can’t find one decent female to live with, I will find many indecent females to die with. If they are intent on denying me life, I will have no choice, but to deny them life. At least I will no longer have to live under the reign of a monkey. America deserves a thousand 9/11s for this outrage.” 

“Their arrogance, indifference and treachery will finally be exposed, and punished. If I can’t make a living, I will make a killing. I realize now, more than ever, that I don’t belong in a society bent on emasculation, mongrelization, and niggerization. I will be successful with females: if I can’t be successful at being positive, I will be successful at being negative. This is in their court, however. This is not what I wanted. No kid sits in their room at night dreaming of this. It has come to this though, and I simply have no choice at this point. It is a moral imperative.”

But was Beierle actually an incel or a failed, redpilled normie?

At 6’2 and 240 pounds, Beierle was neither a manlet nor a framelet. He was white. He held positions of responsibility throughout his life: he was the senior class vice president in high school, an Eagle Scout, and won an athletic award in football. Later in life, he earned a bachelor’s degree and two master’s degrees. He was a commissioned officer in the U.S. Army and a public school teacher.

Based on the case report from the Tallahassee Police Department, Beierle referenced “Tonya” in a video he recorded in 2013, a German woman he dated while he was in the Army. Beierle said she was “the best I was able to do” and was the only female he did not resent, and described how “Tonya” broke up with him. However, none of Beierle’s relatives could corroborate “Tonya’s” existence.

These new details from the NTAC report would not comport with any consensus that Beierle was “involuntary celibate”, certainly not to the degree that most .is members are.

FBI tip ignored: so-called “warning signs” protected by the First Amendment

In conducting a threat assessment, the U.S. Secret Service said near the beginning of the report, “the identified behaviors involve activities that are protected by the Constitution and should be viewed with those protections in mind.”



Indeed, according to the NTAC report, the wife of one of Scott Beierle’s childhood friends filed a tip to the FBI three months before the 2018 shooting. She was reportedly concerned by the violent and misogynistic content of Beierle’s songs. The FBI deemed the tip non-actionable, because “even violently themed lyrics are protected speech unless they target a particular person, place or event,” said an FBI official interviewed by the Washington Post. “In this situation, there wasn’t a specific threat.”

This isn’t news to anyone who even remotely understands First Amendment jurisprudence, of course. Speech that espouses hatred is not entitled to any less constitutional protection than speech that does not.

No, it wasn’t terrorism

In policy or law, it’s important to pay attention to what people say—but it’s equally important to pay attention to what people don’t say.

And what the U.S. Secret Service didn’t do was describe the Hot Yoga incident as “terrorism”, despite calls by SJWs to label “misogynist extremism” as such. Nor was Elliot Rodger’s 2014 shooting or Roy Den Hollander’s 2020 shooting described as “terrorism”. Indeed, not once did the words “terror”, “terrorist”, or “terrorism” appear in the 28-page, 10,230-word report.

The NTAC report is emblematic of American law enforcement’s broad refusal to describe incels or “misogynists” as terrorists, and rightly so. While self-described “CVE practitioners”—from feminazi activists to far-left academics—argue that inceldom should be considered terrorism, government officials and lawyers are reluctant to cave into SJW hysteria and make such a classification. A similar dynamic unfolded across the pond last year: after Jake Davison killed his mother and four others with a shotgun in Plymouth, England, SJWs sought to have the incident classified as “incel terrorism”, only to be rebuffed by senior officials at UK Counter Terrorism Policing.

In any case, the reasoning is technical but straightforward: very broadly speaking, terrorism is the use of mass violence to further a political or religious cause, and (accusations of) “misogyny” in and of itself is neither explicitly political nor religious. A term as loaded as “terrorism” is and should be a legal, not political, decision.

Commentary



This U.S. Secret Service report is high on descriptive detail—most of it was devoted toward examining Beierle’s life and background—but very light on policy prescriptions. Although they created a panel to explain the origins of the incel community, NTAC researchers tried to frame the Hot Yoga shooting within a broader understanding of “misogynist extremism” as opposed to singling out the incel community. They concluded by noting that when conducting a threat assessment, “the individual’s behavior should remain the primary focus,” regardless of any self-affixed ideological labels, adding that “there is no one profile of an individual who plans or executes an act of targeted violence. Attackers vary in age, race, sex, education level, employment history and other characteristics.”

This is evidently not the searing denunciation of the incel community that some SJWs were hoping for. The report’s overall lukewarm tone is not indicative of any impending crackdown on incel communities, nor does it lay down a research framework for such a crackdown in the future. In fact, the report does not mention incel communities or online radicalization at all. Indeed, NTAC’s explicit invocation of our constitutional right to shitpost and their refusal to denote “misogynist extremism” as “terrorism” suggests that federal law enforcement will proceed rationally and preserve the status quo.

Studies expecting to find discrimination against women often find discrimination against males instead,Blackpill,Deleted member 6781,"May 21, 2020",17000,48,"I took this from a Reddit post. Men without any power or privilege (most men) are deffinitely victims of a lot of bullshit. Something society likes to ignore. 



There is a lot of research where the authors admit that they expected to find evidence of discrimination against women, but instead found evidence of discrimination against men.

Sometimes they take it gracefully and report their results in good faith. But other times they make excuses for it or try to cover it up.

The following is a list of 13 examples ranging from hiring discrimination, domestic violence, educational discrimination, and child custody discrimination.

Many of these are areas where people still assume that discrimination against women exists, despite formal academic research showing that it's really men who are discriminated against.

A study about employment discrimination against women and mothers instead uncovered discrimination against men and fathers
One study on hiring discrimination looked at the effects of marriage and parental status on a person's hiring prospects. They expected to find discrimination against women and against mothers specifically. What they found instead was that in every cohort, women were preferred over men. Whether single, married, childless, or with children. Instead of reporting on this novel finding, they instead went into detail about how pregnant women are discriminated against compared to non-pregnant women, which they try to frame as being sexist against women.

The fact that they found that women were preferred over men is buried inside of the body of the study, buffered by handwaving remarks about how pregnant women still face other difficulties related to employment (which I'm sure is valid but they straight up sound salty about the fact that their own research contradicted what they expected to find).

You can read the full text of the study here:

A study about domestic violence against women finds that men are more likely to be victims
A 2005 study on domestic violence wrote their entire abstract in a way that implies that domestic violence is significantly worse against women than against men. But the actual body of their research reports the exact opposite of that. A fact that other researchers eventually discovered and wrote about. While not strictly about discrimination, they are guilty of expecting to find that things were worse for women when in reality it's men who appear to be disproportionately effected.




[A] recent study found that men are more likely than women to suffer serious injuries in intimate partner relationships and that men are actually less likely than women to use violence in intimate relationships (Felson & Cares, 2005). Some factors are apparently inhibiting men, who are generally much more violent than women (outside intimate relationships), from using violence against their female partners. Results in the Felson and Cares (2005) study show that those men who do engage in violence against their spouse and those women who engage in violence against their family members are more likely than other offenders to do so with high frequency. It is surprising that this result was obtained in what was essentially presented to respondents as, “a study of violence against women” (Felson & Cares, 2005, p. 15).In fact, the authors argue that men actually inhibit violence in intimate relationships compared to their non-intimate levels.
...Interestingly, authors responding to findings that suggest a narrow or non-existent gender gap in partner abuse rates also allege that females are universally more vulnerable to abuse by men than men are to abuse by women. Importantly, this perspective has found little support in the data.

The 1975 US National Family Violence survey uncovered higher rates of abuse against men
The very first large scale federal study on domestic violence in the US was carried out by researchers who expected to find higher rates of female victimization compared to male victimization. The results of that study showed that slightly more men than women were victims of domestic violence, including severe forms of violence.

Two of those researchers -- Murray Straus and Suzanne Steinmetz -- spent the rest of their careers researching this phenomen after discovering this. Steinmetz, in particular, was the first researcher to coin the ""battered husband syndrome"" back in 1977, a concept that would eventually be coopted by feminists during the 1980s and derided as a ""myth"" when applied to men.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1891/1946-6560.1.3.332

Related to this is the fact that Erin Pizzey discovered the same thing ""on the ground"" after opening the world's first domestic violence shelter for women in Britain. She attempted to open one for men the very next year after becoming convinced that domestic violence was not a gendered issue, but quickly faced resistance. Including from some of the same people who backed her shelter for women.

All of the relevant parties here took this in stride and bravely went against the status quo. In some instances they even received death threats and bomb threats from feminists. This myth has continued to persists after decades of research debunking it. Likely because people simply want to believe that it's true.

Multiple CDC sexual victimization surveys have found similar rates of female-on-male sexual assault as male-on-female sexual assault, despite famously reporting the opposite
Several studies on sexual assault have found near equal rates of male victimization as female victimization.

While there are a few ""honest"" studies out there, several well-known studies have tried to hide this fact in their research. The primary strategy they use is to define female-on-male rape as ""something else that's not rape"". There are other criticisms that come up though, including the issue of ""priming"" respondents.

Recently the CDC has come under fire for this.




This striking finding—that men and women reported similar rates of nonconsensual sex in a 12-month period—might have made for a newsworthy finding. Instead, the CDC’s public presentation of these data emphasized female sexual victimization, thereby (perhaps inadvertently) confirming gender stereotypes about victimization.

A study trying to prove that mothers are discriminated against in family court instead found the exact opposite, and then tried to hide it
A study from the late 1980s on child custody discrimination expected to find discrimination against mothers, and not fathers, but instead discovered that men were 6 times less likely to gain custody compared to identically placed women.

Not only did their publication attempt to use dishonest statistical shenanigans to hide this, they tried to burry the raw data to prevent other researchers from double checking their findings. Their study is still widely cited by other researchers as well as by random people on the Internet, because it is the only study that, on the surface, found discrimination against mothers (making it the perfect example of ""cherry picking evidence""). In one meta study it sticks out like a sore thumb in comparison to ~10 other studies that found the exact opposite.

Unsubstantiated reports that women were underrepresented in medical research has created a large gap against male medical research
The researchers in this case may not have had a bias, but the research was conducted because of a general assumption that medical research was unfairly focused on men. The complaints were loud enough to inspire research into the topic where it was quickly discovered that far more interest and money is put into women's health research than men's, including even in areas where men are known to be effected more.

Recently John Oliver repeated these myths, despite some of this research being almost 20 years old now.

A study expecting to find discrimination against girls in math and science instead found that boys are discriminated against in literally every single subject
Another study on educational discrimination expected to find discrimination against female students, in part to explain why girls struggle in math and science. They instead found exactly the opposite of this: that male students were discriminated against in every subject, including even in math and science. This study was honest in how they reported their results though. And the researchers were humble enough to admit that they expected to find different results in the abstract.




Using data on test results in several subjects in the humanities and sciences, I found, contrary to expectations, that male students face discrimination in each subject.

A researcher expecting to find discrimination against women in STEM instead found discriminated against men
An unpublished experiment meant to find discrimination against women in STEM instead found evidence of the opposite. The researcher masked the voices of candidates so that their gender wouldn't be known in interviews. The idea was that female candidates would do better than what they do when their gender is known. She instead found that this gender blind process benefited men instead of women, indicating that there was gender discrimination against men.

A study reporting discrimination against women in music instead found, and then tried to hide, evidence of discrimination against men
A widely cited study on orchestra auditions that supposedly found evidence of discrimination against women is flawed, and may in fact show the opposite. The results were not statistically significant since the data was flawed to begin with, which is perhaps what allowed the original researchers to mold it to their pre-determined conclusions. However, it does support the idea that men are discriminated against, a fact that shows up in their own data tables plain as day inside of the study.




The research went uncriticized for nearly two decades. That changed recently, when a few scholars and data scientist went back and read the whole study. The first thing that noticed is that the raw tabulations showed women doing worse [during blind auditions].

Feminist inspired ""investigations"" into pay discrimination against women at Google and the BBC instead found that men were being underpaid
Companies often come under fire for allegedly paying women less then men. Two companies that recently vowed to fix this instead learned that they were underpaying men, not women. Both have vowed to give raises to their male employees to fix a pay gap that they never expected to have.

Feminists have pointed out that men still outnumber women in high paid upper management positions, which might technically be true. But that wasn't the conclusion that they were fishing for when they first put pressure on these companies to look into this (ie, ""equal pay for equal work"").

If you know of any others, feel free to post them in the comments. I just think it's funny that people are so confident that women have things worse that they automatically expect their research to back this up. This tendency to assume that women have things worse and are discriminated against is itself, I would argue, essentially a form of discrimination against men. Especially when those researchers try to hide or misinterpret their findings.

That's not to say that there aren't areas where women are legitimately discriminated against. People just tend to make assumptions in that direction that often don't pan out. In fact, the entire idea that men might face discrimination, and not as some kind of side effect of a greater form of discrimination against women, is almost sacrilegious to some people.

There is, incidentally, evidence of discrimination against research that dares to focus on men or men's issues. Research that focuses on men's issues gets cited less, reported in the media less, and the researchers involved have less access to academic resources and grant money compared to researchers who look into women's issues.

So maybe that's why some of these researchers downplay their findings when they find evidence of discrimination against men.

For example:

https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/...fic-bias-in-favor-studies-finding-gender-bias

I wonder how many studies have gone unpublished because the researchers didn't like their results, and knew it could negatively impact their careers. And I wonder how many of the studies showing discrimination against men were perhaps originally hypothesized to find discrimination against women, but were begrudgingly published anyway. In either case, this bias seems to run pretty deep. Which is something you wouldn't normally expect to find in academia.

This is based on women's self report, not behavior, so could be inaccurate as we know women lack self awareness, but I still think it's worthwhile data and the best we have.
Implications for Tallcels:
I think this data explains why many guys on this forum say being 6'2"" makes them no more attractive than their better looking 5'10"" friends. According to women's preferences, a 6'2"" guy is not significantly more broadly attractive than a 5'10"" man. (However, please see the caveat reviewed already as this likely does not fully tell the story.)

Implications for Heightmaxing:
Lifts are an easy looksmax. LL is controversial and obviously terrible for most men given the costs and risks. Either way, it is commonly questioned which heights of men would benefit most from lifts or LL.

To evaluate this, I graphed how much more women will consider a man (as a multiplier) based on a 2"" increase in height at each increment. A 2"" height increase is attainable both by LL and lifts. So, in this graph, a multiplier of 2 means twice as many women will accept men of this height if they grow 2"" from their current height.





Primary Findings:

We see from this the peak benefits of a 2"" height gain are in the 5'4-5'6"" range, and men in the 5'3"" to 5'7"" range all benefit tremendously.
A 5'4"" man will have 2.3 times as many potential female partners by gaining 2"" height (imagine the personality improvement!).
A 5'7"" man will have 1.86 times as many potential female partners by gaining 2"" height.
Benefits become insignificant past 5'10"". This would be reflective of the same points as above - once you are ""tall enough"" it seems not to matter much except perhaps for the height fetishist women who are not accounted for here.
Below 5'1"" a 2"" height gain makes no difference for men as you are still too short no matter what.
Competitor Analysis:
There are very few women who will accept a man below 5'7"" or so. These women who accept short men will also accept taller men, and therefore have absolutely massive pools of men to choose from. So while some women exist who will consider a shorter man, a shorter man must compete against a tremendously greater number of other men to secure one of these women.

This reflects the number of other men a man must beat in order to secure a woman who accepts him for his height:





Results:

A 5' man must beat 13 other men to date a woman who will accept him for his height.
A 5'4"" man must beat 8 other men to date a woman who will accept him for his height.
Between 5'10"" and 6'4"", the advantage shifts towards these tall men, and the number of male competitors per women drops below 1.
Final Conclusions:
Unless you are extremely tall to appeal to that minority of women who want massive men, height is more of an elimination criteria than a criteria that will predictably make you more attractive. ie. It is very easy for a man to get cut out of the dating pool due to height (ie. being progressively sub 5'10""), but it is likely hard to get laid solely based on height unless you are very, very tall.

Height increases matter most in the 5'3"" to 5'7"" range and a 2"" height increase can roughly double your appeal to women in this range.

A small minority of women are willing to accept short men (sub 5'8""), but because these women are also willing to accept tall men, the competition for a shorter man to get one is insane."
For IncelTears - Feminism Is A Self Defeating Prospect Because It Defies Female Nature,Blackpill,BlkPillPres,"Nov 20, 2018",10000,30,"One of the most obvious examples of this, is the ""gender equality paradox""

https://www.thejournal.ie/gender-equality-countries-stem-girls-3848156-Feb2018/



One would think that the higher the standard of gender equality in a country, the more likely women are to enter into work fields that they were once ""forced away from"" by the dreaded patriarchy via the ""glass ceiling"". However that would be one who is illogical and not honest with themselves about biological realities.

The reason why the paradox seems like a paradox (when it isn't) to individuals of ""the left"", is because their logic is inherently flawed, it isn't a paradox. Of course what can I expect from a group that can't accept the most basic of biological reality's - IF YOU ARE BORN WITH XY CHROMOSOMES AND A PENIS, YOU ARE A MAN, NO SURGERY OR MAKE OVER CAN CHANGE THAT FACT, but I digress, back to the matter at hand.

Here are the reasons why:
1. Women don't want to work - They don't like physical exertion, unless it relates to fucking an attractive male. This is why they work more part time hours than men statistically, and stay away from STEM field jobs that require long and dedicated hourly shifts of work, often involving overtime. They are not only the physically weaker sex, but they are the mentally weaker sex, in both matters of academia and dealing with stress, male suicide rates are only higher because society treats men like utter garbage in comparison to women.

Every guy I know has had first hand experience in a situation where the women around them were panicking and it was up to them to calm them down and solve the problem. Women don't enjoy the stress of the work world, the deadlines, the office politics, etc becomes all too much for them unless they are the ones instigating the drama, then they like it, but when it comes to the actual work part, tough luck inspiring enthusiasm

This is why they prefer jobs will little to no physical effort or mental effort, it allows for free time, and for them to ""play during work"" (gossiping, etc)

2. Women don't have to work to get their ""base needs"" satisfied - Men will always be more drawn to work, because romantic relationships between men and women function under a model of prostitution, all men know we need to have access to resources to gain access to sex. Women don't need that, any 5/10 woman can land a 6/10 or 7/10 boyfriend and/or husband due to the changes that feminism has made in society, those men are going to have well paying jobs, especially because statistically the more attractive a man is, the more likely he has a high paying job (looks helps a lot in various facets of life).

So feminism has ironically made it easier for women to be ""house wives"", of course they won't jump into that role before they get some prime time riding the cock carousel, but nonetheless, it is their final destination. That's the greatest irony of feminism, because of bias they ignore the inherent nature of women, and because they ingore that, they can't accurately predict the outcomes of collectively giving women rights and privileges.

How stupid do you have to be, to think that you will give women a ""sexual revolution"" and it will give them a reason to work harder, prioritize career pursuits over the pursuit of Chads cock, and to champion breaking the glass ceiling when they can sit at home comfy doing barely nothing all day while their husband slaves away.

Every base need from food, shelter, security, and yes sex, can be easily attained from a man by every woman just for simply existing, feminism has just made that easier, so why would you expect them to not take advantage of that.

3. Their pursuit of Chad - Do I even need to go into detail on this, the advent of Tinder, and the effect that it had on the dating world and male SMV is obvious enough.

Feminism = feeding into women's nature and expecting them to go against it

Women don't really want to do ""hard work"", they never really wanted to, the ""freedom"" that their biological imperatives were driving them to attain, was merely MORE FREE TIME to fuck attractive males and bear their children, and the delusion of feminists not to acknowledge this, is why no matter what policies they implement, women's choices remain the same as when the ""patriarchy"" was ""forcing them"" to make those choices.

By giving women more rights, more freedom, and more privileges, all you've done is giving them more free time, and more options to choose from, to carry out their biological imperatives. The easier you make it for women to chase chad, the more time they'll spend chasing chad, not working, not building a career, their main focus will always be fucking chad. It always has been and always will be.

Feminism is the real paradox. The entire purpose of feminism is to give women the freedom TO DO WHAT THEY WANT, well earth to feminists, WHAT WOMEN WANT TO DO, IS FUCK CHAD AND ENJOY THEIR FREE TIME ""HAVING FUN"".

Its the same reason why statistically men work more overtime and women work more part time hours, its not because the patriarchy is forcing women not to work more hours, ITS BECAUSE WOMEN DON'T REALLY WANT TO WORK PERIOD, THEY PREFER LEISURE TIME.

Its kinda funny, stuff like this likely frustrates a lot of feminists and sends them in a rage, confused by this paradox, some might even call these women ""ungrateful"" - ""How dare they not go out into STEM fields and slave away while their ovaries rot and their biological clock ticks""

Dear Mr's/Mr Feminist, would you prefer they end up like this bitch - https://www.washingtonpost.com/news...ork-out/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.36215aa76915

Some women may fall for the feminist agenda due to indoctrination, but most are still driven primarily by their biological imperatives. Between the two sexes, women are more like animals than men are, its like they aren't really conscious of their own existence, so easily manipulated by agendas and also still so easily manipulated by their own programming, they lack true introspective thought, which is why their conversations are never about such things."

@SergeantIncel pin?"
A word about attraction and why nothing you do works,Venting,Deleted member 32502,"Mar 17, 2021",18000,42,"This is wet water post for anyone who is blackpilled but I still see some bluepillers here who talk about approaching. I collected some information that's already posted here many times.

So why doesn't approaching work? Can self improvement save you?

The thing bluepillers, certain hate group on CuckIT and PUAcels get wrong is who is actually the one choosing. Even if you approach a w*man it's the w*man who picks (or doesn't pick) you. W*men pick men, not the other way around. They hold all the power in the markets. Men are more generous with their distribution of romantic and sexual interest than women. Far more generous. Women have far more options and they are far pickier than men. There are far more women who men would reject than are men who women would accept.













Women find tall men attractive. This is an undeniable fact. I doubt anyone denies this. Short men have abysmal chances to find romantic opportunities.









Why Many Women Want to Be With Tall Men


When it comes to finding a romantic partner, what’s a short man to do?




www.psychologytoday.com









So if you don't make it in height and facial attractiveness then you should try to have more of that infamous ""pewsonalitee   "" right?

Your attractiveness is personality. There is a strong correlation with your physical attractiveness and your personality.






The reason PUA and approaching doesn't work and there is no such thing as game or personality is because it takes some milliseconds to decide whether someone is attractive or not.

https://incels.is/threads/it-takes-...tractive-faces-from-unattractive-faces.42177/
Attraction is predetermined. They have already decided whether you are attractive or not before you can make your move and play your ""game"" or show off your ""personality.""

When women see you for half a second they have already made up their mind. You are not tall enough. You are not attractive enough. Nothing that comes out of your mouth will change their opinion. If w*men see an attractive tall man it doesn't matter what comes out of their mouth. They can be nice, rude, arrogant, confident, timid, shy, sociable, tense, whatever. They can run whatever ""game"" they want because their attraction was predetermined before they opened their mouth.

You can't self improve yourself out of this. You are preselected attractive man or you are not. There is no inbetweeners. The amount of plates you lift doesn't matter. The clothes you wear don't matter. The education you have doesn't matter. The classique literature you have read doesn't matter.

https://incels.is/threads/study-chi...ore-sex-partners-and-one-night-stands.276744/
There are men who play vidya and smoke weed all day but they have no trouble getting women. There are men who go to prison once a year and they run harems. There are men who beat up their girlfriends frequently but they are always in a relationship and never struggle to date. And everyone blames the incel who is never given a chance to go on a date while Chad is smashing his girlfriend's skull.

And then there's some men who go to universities and acquire fancy certificates and go through demanding education programs yet remain incel.

Centenary day of male disposability,Blackpill,jerrycan dan,"Nov 10, 2018",10000,60,"The first-up timezones, such as New Zealand's, have already entered the 100th anniversary of the end of WW1. A hundred years ago an armistice ended a war which had caused more casualties than any other war for the past eight-tenths of a millennium. The rest of the Asia-Pacific, Western Eurasia, Africa and the Americas won't be far behind experiencing the 11th of November on the 100th anniversary of the armistice. It has been exactly a century since the First World War, which as a fully mechanised war was the first large-scale conflict of its kind, and the first conflict of its kind large enough to be considered a World War.

As with the anniversary of any major modern war, millions of virtue-signalling normies across the world will speak out against violence on the 11th of the 11th and preach to the choir about the ""lessons"" we learned after turning at least ten million soldiers' insides into mince so they could die horribly sprawled out on a field somewhere in Flanders or the Dardanelles. War is bad, yada yada yada, commemorate the lives that have lost. Instead of looking at the lessons that everybody pretends to have learned, maybe we should look at things people FAILED to learn after the First World War (and the second, and every modern war that came after that).






People failed to learn how to give a shit about men. Foids working in factories during the war got women the vote and welfare systems got better after all the veterans came home (probably because governments were scared of communist revolution JFL), but did anybody really care about the millions of faceless, unmarried young men who were conscripted and died horribly in the war? Maybe their mothers did for a while, but apart from that who really cared? Who cares today?

How many men fell flat on their faces and died after being shot in the back by a person they never even saw, but whose names, despite their sacrifice, are not remembered by a single living person today? They exist on a memorial plaque somewhere in France, nobody gives a shit about them. Propaganda posters waxed poetic about ""dying for your country"" and ""manning up"", but as usual that always meant throwing millions of expendable young men into the meat grinder. They are gone forever, no normalfag actually gives a shit about even a millionth of what they went through in that war.

Even in the 1910s, when the war was actively happening around everyone, men were socially pressured into throwing their lives away for a bunch of faggot aristocrats (fuck you Churchill, rot in hell for what you did at the Dardanelles) by being given a white feather by foids for not enlisting. Essentially you would be branded a coward for not manning up and throwing your life away in the most horrible way possible, because nobody gives a shit about men. Killing ten million of them won't reduce the amount of foids that can be impregnated by the remainder, biology decrees that they are disposable and might as well be thrown away to die painfully.

If, even during a war when millions of people are dying for nothing in horrible conditions, people did not give a shit about young men like ourselves, do you really expect anybody to give a shit about us now? Is it any surprise we get copouts like ""therapy"", ""personality"" and ""shower"" that essentially mean ""know your place, don't rock the boat"" instead of being given actual honesty by people? For men today who have problems considered far more legitemate than ours by normies, such as the homeless, do people give a shit about them? Fuck no, most homeless people are men and the majority of homeless shelters in many western cities cater to women because women are so precious and vulnerable. Men are responsible for the vast, vast majority of all suicides, but whenever a roastie kills herself it gets on the news. The man working a dead end job at a petrol station in his 30s killing himself after his fat wife divorces him is not something anybody gives a shit about. After all, men are disposable.

Surely if you survived and came back to your home country after the war you would receive some sort of thanks, right? JFL, barely fucking any. Especially if you happen to have lost a limb or two.

The following piece of text is a poem by a person called Wilfred Owen who fought on the Western front and made poems about World War One. The poem is about a man who loses his legs in the war, comes back to Britain in a wheelchair and is rejected by everyone (especially foids) for being disabled. Before he lost his legs in the war he was wanted by foids for his looks, but after becoming disabled he is doomed to die alone and involuntarily celibate. What about his personality, surely he is a brave lad? Surely he is a ""decent human being"" for almost sacrificing his life for his country? Surely women will see past his new disability and love him for who he is?



Spoiler



He sat in a wheeled chair, waiting for dark,

And shivered in his ghastly suit of grey,

Legless, sewn short at elbow. Through the park

Voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn,

Voices of play and pleasure after day,

Till gathering sleep had mothered them from him.



* * * * *



About this time Town used to swing so gay

When glow-lamps budded in the light-blue trees,

And girls glanced lovelier as the air grew dim,—

In the old times, before he threw away his knees.

Now he will never feel again how slim

Girls' waists are, or how warm their subtle hands,

All of them touch him like some queer disease.



* * * * *



There was an artist silly for his face,

For it was younger than his youth, last year.

Now, he is old; his back will never brace;

He's lost his colour very far from here,

Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry,

And half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race

And leap of purple spurted from his thigh.



* * * * *



One time he liked a blood-smear down his leg,

After the matches carried shoulder-high.

It was after football, when he'd drunk a peg,

He thought he'd better join. He wonders why.

Someone had said he'd look a god in kilts.

That's why; and maybe, too, to please his Meg,

Aye, that was it, to please the giddy jilts,

He asked to join. He didn't have to beg;

Smiling they wrote his lie: aged nineteen years.

Germans he scarcely thought of, all their guilt,

And Austria's, did not move him. And no fears

Of Fear came yet. He thought of jewelled hilts

For daggers in plaid socks; of smart salutes;

And care of arms; and leave; and pay arrears;

Esprit de corps; and hints for young recruits.

And soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers.



* * * * *



Some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer Goal.

Only a solemn man who brought him fruits

Thanked him; and then inquired about his soul.



* * * * *



Now, he will spend a few sick years in institutes,

And do what things the rules consider wise,

And take whatever pity they may dole.

Tonight he noticed how the women's eyes

Passed from him to the strong men that were whole.

How cold and late it is! Why don't they come

And put him into bed? Why don't they come?



No, they won't. They never will, they don't care. Nobody cares about men's problems, even if they expect men to throw away their lives for nothing in return. Nothing has changed in 2018. You are expendable, no matter what you do, unless you manage to get appropriate LMS both foids and society at large won't see you as a fully-fledged human being. Even if you have enough LMS to be considered a valid option by foids, even as betabuxx, you will still be expected to throw your fucking life away for whores, roasties and single mothers you've never met while they sit safely at home away from the front lines (as was the case in the English-speaking world, anyway).

Nobody gives a shit about men. Nobody gives a shit about us. We are disposable, we are expendable, and despite dozens of millions of young men dying in this century alone because of that nobody has bothered to change that. To all the males who were killed for nothing in WW1 because they were born with a penis and were therefore acceptable for throwing into a meat grinder, lest we forget.

To every cuck and foid that still thinks men's struggles are trivial and womyn need special protection, fuck you. You deserve to be put in the trenches a million times more than any of these innocent young men did. I hope you die in a chlorine gas attack blinded, with your skin burning, and with bloody froth coming out of your mouths you fucking faggots"
Incel trait: you weren't breastfed (GET THE FUCK IN MY THREAD GUYS),Blackpill,Deleted member 33464,"Mar 18, 2021",16000,55,"To Spinoza, desire is a productive process, and positive as opposed to being derived from lack. It is all encompassing and autonomous. To sum it up, in ""ethics"" Spinoza says desire is:



the very essence of man, as it is conceived as determined to do something by some affection given within it

Click to expand...

Owing to this, Deleuze and Guattari in ""Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia"" coin the term ""Desiring Machines"" to refer to the site of this production. Every machine is interconnected. It is both a stop in the flow of all the machines, and the flow itself, or the production of a flow. The flow is universal and nonpersonal; it is a multiplicity which constitutes the very essence of man.
The breast is a machine which produces milk, and the mouth a machine latched onto it. When the breast and mouth connect, each of them have intensity, or an amount of energy or pressure, which drives them to connect. The sucking machine refers to the desire for sucking and feeding, which exercises pressure on the breast and the mouth. The sucking machine is nevertheless impersonal, and it is really intensity which makes the breast and the mouth connect. And I can't stress this enough, this is not a metaphor. Desiring production IS the production of production.



It functions everywhere, at times without break, at times discontinuously. It breathes, it heats, it eats. It shits, it fucks. What a mistake to have ever said the it. Everywhere it is machines, not at all metaphorically : machines of machines, with their couplings, their connections. An organ-machine is connected to a source-machine : the one produces a ﬂow that the other cuts. The breast is a machine that produces milk, and the mouth a machine coupled to it. The anorexic’s mouth wavers between an eating-machine , an anal machine, a talking machine, a breathing machine (asthma attack). Hence we are all handymen: each with his little machines. An organ-machine, for an energy-machine: all the time, ﬂows and cuts. Judge Schreber has divine rays in his ass.

Social production in the framework of capitalism is characterized by a radical opposition between production and anti-production. In order to fight revolutionary desire, it has to rely on territoriality:



Capitalism establishes or restores all kinds of residual and fake, imaginary or symbolic territorialities. Everything is rebuilding or restoring states, homelands, families. This is what makes capitalism in its ideology: the colorful painting of everything that has been believed

Click to expand...

Furthermore, capitalism focusing on abstract concepts of money and labor encourages desire to change across the social field in unexpected ways. One example of this is Oedipalization, where our anarchic productivity of unconscious desire is reduced to familial forms of desire. Productive desire that ﬂows according to immanent principles becomes organized in terms of ""lack"", and reducing the multiple forms desire can take to just forms that can be referred to the personal identities of the Oedipal triangle. Oedipalization gives the illusion that partial objects are possessed by a person and that it is the person who desires. Productive desire that would fragment personal identity is reduced to the desire of a person who wants to fill in a lack. Oedipalization ensures that the innovations of deterritorialising capital are constrained by the tightly bound parameters of personal identity and familial life. It is a form of social repression that funnels the productive capacity of the unconscious back into the constricting channels of Oedipal desire.

Let's take a look at the nuclear family. It is essentially the agent of repressing our desires in the capitalist system, and not being breastfed only exacerbates this. As children we are made to direct our love towards an object, the mother, who is unobtainable because of the presence of the father. Because this is incestuous, as children we associate our sexual desires with feelings of shame and guilt. In the beginning, we all start as incel. In the words of Deleuze and Guattari:



It is in one and the same movement that the repressive social production is replaced by the repressing family, and that the latter offers a displaced image of desiring production that represents the repressed as incestuous familial drives.

Click to expand...

Because incest isn't allowed, the breast the child sucks now belongs to the child's mother. The intense, impersonal production is now assigned personal ""meaning"". Other figures come along now that we can't have incest, the father, the brother, etc. Assigning meaning to this extends desire and makes personal what was once impersonal, and codifies a regulation on desire. What is even more brutal is when the child is never able to possess his mother's breast, the desire persists into adulthood, as Freud tells us. Capitalism needs this psychological repression to make us into docile wageslaves who will accept humiliating and insulting working conditions.

Inceldom is thus an Oedipal revolt against the father (chad) for the mother we were never allowed to love.

TLDR: CAPITALISM AND THE NUCLEAR FAMILY (AS AGENTS OF REPRESSION) CAUSE THE INCEL PHENOMENON"
"Study shows singlehood is only tolerable for people when they are sexually satisfied ""but being single isn't bad!!!!!!1""",Discussion,Edmund_Kemper,"Apr 21, 2022",7000,80,"Many humans like to tell us that they're single and they're fine with it, and that relationships aren't important in life. Well here's the thing, many of these humans have been in relationships many times and got it out of their system anyways. Additionally, singlehood, studies show, is only acceptable for humans to endure when they experience sexual satisfaction during singlehood. In order to enjoy singlehood, you have to have sexual satisfaction. Without that sexual satisfaction, single humans tend to be tormented by singlehood, and they tend to be satisfied with singlehood or believe happiness while single is possible if they experience sexual satisfaction during singlehood. Studies found that single humans were less sexually satisfied than partnered humans. In order for single humans to experience sexual satisfaction, they have to either lack sex but have low sexual desire, or have strong sexual desire, but still have sex a lot. Single humans with strong sexual desire were less sexually satisfied but this is because singles have sex less often than partnered people, otherwise they are sexually satisfied if they crave frequent sex and still have sex regularly.



Among single individuals, higher levels of dyadic sexual desire were consistently associated with lower sexual satisfaction, whether it was assessed with SDI-2 or as desired frequency of partnered activities (at the correlational level). When accounting for both desired and actual frequency of engaging in partnered activities, however, the strength of main effects of desired frequency dropped. Instead, there was an interaction between desired and actual frequencies such that wanting more frequent partnered sexual activities was associated with lower sexual satisfaction only if individuals were not participating in the desired activities very frequently. These data suggest that singles with relatively high sexual desire for partnered sexual activities may experience sexual frustration when not able to find sexual partners, which in turn contributes to dissatisfaction with their sex lives (and thus perhaps with their singlehood; Park et al., 2021). On the other hand, singles with low sexual desire (e.g., asexual individuals, e.g., Bogaert, 2015) may fare relatively well in singlehood by sidestepping sexual frustration from unmet needs for partnered sexual activities.

Click to expand...







In the authors' previous study, they found that sexually active singles were less sexually satisfied, but that could be because they had low sexual desire but still had sex frequently or because they didn't like uncommitted sex (or casual sex) as much. I bet the sexually satisfied singles in that study who didn't have sex had low sexual desire. Nonetheless, they found in that study that sexual satisfaction during singlehood was the key to being satisfied with singlehood:



Despite the worldwide increase in single-person households, little research has examined what factors contribute to a satisfying single life. We used three data sets (N = 3,890) to examine how satisfaction with sexual and social aspects of life are linked with single people’s perceptions of marriage and singlehood. Our results suggest that higher sexual satisfaction is associated with less desire to marry (Study 1), stronger beliefs that unmarried people can be happy without marriage (Study 2), and greater satisfaction with singlehood and less desire for a partner (Study 3). All effects in Studies 1 and 3 remained significant controlling for life satisfaction and sexual frequency. Satisfying friendships were associated with variables related to satisfaction with singlehood but not variables related to desire for a partner, whereas no effect was found for satisfaction with family. This study highlights the potential importance of maintaining a satisfying sex life in people’s satisfaction with singlehood.

A Norwegian study found this:



The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which Norwegians are satisfied with their singlehood, and to determine the association between being sin- gle and sexual activity. Data were obtained from a questionnaire survey of a representative web sample of 1076 unpartnered individuals (568 women, 508 men) aged 18–89 years. A total of 45.2% of the single respondents reported being satisfied with being single, while 33.9% reported being unsatisfied. There was no difference between the age groups in men, but more women aged 45 years or older than women under the age of 45 were satisfied with being single. A higher percentage of gay, bisexual, and transmen than heterosexual men was satisfied with being single. More women who had not been sexually active with a partner in the past year were satisfied with being single than were women who had been sexually active. The men who were most satisfied with being single were those who had masturbated and/ or had sexual intercourse, and least satisfied were those with no sexual activity, or exclusively masturbation activity. The results are discussed in terms of biological, psychological, and social positions.

So why were single women who had less sex more sexually satisfied than ones who had sex? Because women didn't like casual sex (unless it's with a conventionally attractive man because women tend to only like casual sex with a man they find very physically attractive). LGBT men were also satisfied with being single because men are more interested in casual sex than women and gay men have it easier finding a male sex partner than men finding a female sex partner, including when it comes to casual sex.



Another interesting finding was that heterosexual women with no sexual activity in the past 12 months were more satisfied with being single than women who had been sexually active. Furthermore, the heterosexual women who were least satisfied were those who had masturbated and had sexual intercourse. This corroborates a British study, in which a minority of those who had sexual experience but were sex- ually inactive, 35% of men and 24% of women, reported being dissatisfied with their sex lives (Ueda & Mercer, 2019). According to Baumeister (1999), women’s sexual- ity is more plastic than men’s sexuality. This implies that women without access to a committed partner may “turn off” their sex drive altogether, and not longing for something they do not have and releasing energy into other things of importance in life makes them satisfied with singlehood. It can be hypothesized that women who recently had been sexually active with a partner might have been reminded of not having an available partner, which might have caused them to long for one. In that case, it can be argued that they are committed to a romantic ideal, but had either found the wrong partner to enter into a relationship with (Træen & Sørensen, 2000), or had experienced unrequited love (Baumeister, 1993). The finding that men who had less masturbation activity in the past month were more likely to be satisfied with being single indicates that some men may have lower sexual desire than others. However, based on the findings from other studies, it may also be linked to higher levels of avoidant attachment, lower sexual self-esteem and self-confidence, lower sexual satisfaction (Anticevi et al., 2017), or poor flirting skills, unattractiveness, shyness, and bad experiences in previous relationships (Apostolou, 2019).

Park et al.’s study (2021) showed that having a satisfying sexual life was associated with how positively single individuals viewed their singlehood. Men and women are biologically different and undergo different primary sexual socialization processes. Unlike women, both LGBT+men and heterosexual men who were satisfied with their sexual life in general, satisfied with their current level of sexual activity, and who had had sexual intercourse in the past month were more likely to be satisfied with being single. In addition, the relationships were generally stronger for LGBT + men than for heterosexual men. It could be that men in general who are satisfied with their singlehood find it more convenient to have casual partners and to avoid all partners who could become committed partners. LGBT+ men may be able to obtain male sexual partners more readily than heterosexual men can female sexual partners, in part because of men’s greater interest in casual sex (e.g., Schmitt, 2005). According to Eastwick et al. (2019), passion peaks in the early stages of a relationship, and feelings of intimacy and emotional bonding peak in later stages. For single individuals who are satisfied with being single and who still have sexual activity with partners, it could be that it is the drive for passion that is satisfying to them, and that they may not have a desire for emotional bonding with a partner. LGBT + men and women are likely to undergo a new socialization process when coming out as gay (Alonzo & Buttitta, 2019). We found that LGBT+ men were more satisfied with being single than heterosexual men, but there was no difference between LGBT+ women and heterosexual women. LGBT+men may have a larger pool of other men to have sexual interactions with, and in the gay sub-culture there is likely to be a higher acceptance of sex for the sake of pleasure and of not having to legitimize sex with love than in the heterosexual majority culture (Abramson & Pinkerton, 2002; Matsick et al., 2021).

So in order to be happy while single, you need sexual satisfaction. If you don't have sex, you can only be satisfied sexually if you lack sexual desire. If you crave sex while single and still have sex, you will enjoy singlehood (maybe unless you hate casual sex).

SOURCE: Infant' Differential Social Responses to Attractive and Unattractive Faces.
Judith H. Langlois, Lori A. Roggman, and Loretta A. Ricser-Danner

Summary of the experiment:

60 one-year-old infants were recruited from the infant subject pool mantained by the Children's Research Laboratory at the University of Texas. All of the infants were full term, healthy, and from middle-class families. In this study, the infants interact with a stranger in pressence of their mother. Attractiveness of the stranger was manipulated by having thin, lifelike, latex theater masks constructed by a professional mask maker to be either attractive or unattractive.

Because there might be behavorial difference between attractive and unattractive individuals asked to interact with infants, a single female stranger interacted with all of the infants, using a strict, rehearsed script to standarize her behavior. The attractiveness of the stranger was manipulated through the use of professional theater masks. Both attractive and unattractive versions of the masks were worn by the stranger to control for any effects of wearing a mask per se.

A professional mask maker created the masks using the stranger's face as a basic mold. The female stranger was an attractive woman, and a cast of her face served as the attractive mold. Alterationg to this basic mold to create the unattractive version of her face were based on previous research that identified measurements of facial features that predict ratings of attractiveness. The unattractive version of the mask was designed so that the feature sizes were well within the normal range of attractiveness: Our goal was to make the stranger appear unattractive, but not appear abnormal or deformed in any way. The masks were made of very thin latex so that the stranger's face appeared quite real and lifelike. Thus, she was able to talk and smile without appearing strange.

The stranger was blind at all times to which mask she was wearing, so that knowledge of the attractiveness condition of the session could not bias her behavior toward the infant. The stranger coult no differentiate between the masks when she was wearing them because only the external appearance of the mask changed. The stranger was never told which mask she was wearing, and all glass and other shiny surfaces in the building were occluded. To ensure that the stranger's behaviour was in fact equivalent across attractiveness conditions, a random sample of tapes was selected and the length of the stranger's conversation with the infant was timed. The only words that varied in the stranger's script were references to the specific toys with which each individual infants played.

The results showed that infants preference for attractiveness extend beyond visual preferences. The infants more frequently avoided the stranger when she was unattractive than we she was attractive and they showed more negative emotion and distress in the unattractive than in the attractive condition. Furthermore, boys approached the female stranger more ofthen in the attractive than in the unattractive condition."
[STUDY] The reasons women want taller men have to do with traditional gender roles and their own insecurities about their fragile femininity,Toxic Femininity,Edmund_Kemper,"May 6, 2021",17000,75,"https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/75471/Yancey_Does%20Height%20Matter.pdf?sequence=1



JFL this just shows how common fragile feminity is. Men don’t seem to care about feeling tall or masculine or dominant in a relationship. These women all say a bunch of benevolently sexist shit like “I wanna feel protected” or they say they wanna feel small and feminine or still wanna be shorter even when wearing heels (like as if you wear them all the time)



Several studies (e.g., Courtiol et al., 2010; Salska et al., 2008; Swami et al., 2008) have found that taller women are more likely to relax the requirement that the man be taller than her. Tall women do not necessarily say they would accept a male shorter than them, but they are more likely to say it would be acceptable for the male to be of the same height. For short men, they are more likely than tall men to say they would be willing to date women who are their height or even slightly taller.

Our analysis of the answers students provided in the open-ended questions confirmed these assertions. Immediately we saw gender differences in the importance of height for a potential dating partner. For example, it is worth noting that in all the themes documented in Table 2 our female respondents always, although not always significantly, mentioned the concerns of
a particular theme more than men. This can be a proxy for the reality that discussing the height of potential dates is more important to women than it is to men. Nevertheless there are other critical gender differences that should be noted. When asked about why they had minimum height requirements for who they are willing to date, women discussed several issues connected with a traditional gender expectation for men. For example, these young women discussed looking to taller men to feel protected or secure:
. . . height factors into security for me. When a man is taller I feel more protected and secure. (5 feet 4 inches “Other race”2 woman)
Although I am short, I am not attracted to short men. I could meet the most attractive man, but if he is not at least 5′ 7, I am not interested. Tall men represent protection. I feel safe for some reason. (5 feet 1 inches White woman)
In Table 2, we find that nearly a fourth of the women discussed the desire for protection or security in at least one of their answers whereas barely any men discussed issues of protection or security. It is a clear gender difference in the data. The desire to look up or down into a date’s eyes was not as great of a gender difference. But when our female respondents discussed this theme, it was generally the desire to look into a taller man’s eyes that they wanted. In a sense they desired to “look up” to their date:
As the girl I like to feel delicate and secure at the same time. Something just feels weird in thinking about looking “down” into my man’s eyes. There is also something to be said about being able to wear shoes with high heels and still being shorter. I also want to be able to hug him with my arms reaching up and around his neck. (5 feet 3 inches White woman)
It’s always been my personal preference to be able to look up into a guy’s eyes instead seeing him face to face. (5 feet 5 inches “Other race” woman)
This need to feel the man is taller may be tied to another characteristic that came out of our data. Some of the women sometimes felt the need to feel small compared with her partner in order to feel more “feminine.” For exam- ple, one respondent (5 feet inches Hispanic woman) noted that “... if a guy is too short or shorter than me, it makes me feel less feminine.” The average male is biologically taller and larger than the average female so it is not sur- prising that the females in our sample expected to date taller, larger men. However, the desire to date taller men to gain a perception of femininity seems a social, rather than biological, construct indicating the beliefs our society places on the male-taller norm.

Click to expand...





Our sample of college-attending women wanted tall men for a variety of reasons, but some of those reasons tend to indicate preference for tradi- tional gender expectations. As such, it was notable that about 10% of the women wanted a taller date so that they would feel comfortable wearing high heel shoes. Such shoes are clearly a measure of meeting gender norms as only women are expected to wear such shoes. Images of men as strong protectors that women can look up to even in their heels clearly comport with traditional Western gender images. High heels are not used as a height equalizer with men, but as a social marker of feminine attractiveness. Given this social expectation, the young women in our sample often noted the need to find a man taller than them even when wearing high heels. It was clear in the minds of many female respondents that the height of a man helped her to engage in her traditional gender role. In fact a small percent- age of women overtly stated that being with a taller man made them feel more feminine. “I hate to rule it out, but I feel as if dating a much shorter man would make me feel large and unfeminine” (5 feet 7 inches White woman). Thus, many of the reasons women provided for desiring a taller mate can be tied to a desire to adhere to traditional gender roles. They also gave reasons consistent with evolutionary biology, such as expressing that taller men made them feel more secure and protected, both common responses.

The future of therapy: 1984-esque monitoring for potential inceldom,Untagged,Deleted member 4804,"Dec 15, 2021",8000,43,"archive.md



I came across this recently and thought it was a good read. There's apparently a new smartphone app called ""MindLAMP"". It constantly analyzes your behaviour, your movement, your phone usage, and everything to feed it back to your therapist. It also forces you to fill out constant questionnaires on your mood. If it sees that you're not sleeping or not exercising or don't get a good depression score, it can report that back to your therapist.

But more interestingly it takes other data too. mindLAMP periodically tests for social connection among patients by ""using their phones’ microphones to periodically sample audio and identify the presence and qualities of speech that indicate social connection."" So if you are not constantly socially interacting with people, the app will actually detect that nobody other than yourself speaks around you and feed that back to your therapist. GPS data is also checked to see if you regularly go outside or not. So if you're a shut in NEET, you can't hide that anymore. It will be reported that you never go outside or interact with anyone. It's not hard to imagine this technology in the future being used to identify potential incels/general social outcasts for imprisonment/committment.

Recent research at UCLA also created an app designed to detect depression from voice recordings. After the AI model was trained on a large dataset of people who called in and filled out mood questionnaires, the app could analyze voice samples to actually determine how depressed you are. The authors foresee forces people to regularly record audio samples in the app to establish their mood. If you do not feel happy, this will be reported.

Even better was an analysis tool created by the University of Washington. After ""politely asking"" (somehow they got informed consent from people who were locked up against their will) people who were involuntarily committed to a hospital/admitted for a suicide attempt for their internet search history, they found numerous search terms highly correlated with suicide. For example, they found that ""final divorce decree cost"" was one of the most correlated terms with attempted suicide. Psychiatrists in charge of the study proposed that people at risk of suicide have their internet search patterns monitored for terms like these and that certain search terms will be reported to your doctors as indicating a high risk of suicide in the near-future.
The main crux of this post is that this will be the future for all potential incels. You will be forced to install an app on your phone and computer. This app will constantly monitor your behaviour. It will look at whether you go outside. It will randomly record you at different intervals to see if you are talking to others and more importantly see if you're happy talking to others. It will look at your search and browsing history. If you are socially isolated, if you are physically isolated, if you are searching the wrong things or speaking in the wrong way it will know and it will be reported to your psychiatrist, who will involuntarily commit you as a danger to yourself and others if you are unable to fix your state of isolation. There will be no opportunity to hide for incels. 

Gone are days past where you could slip off the grid to live a NEET life, forgotten by the government bureaucracy. For centuries that was the easiest way to escape the government. You could live as a hermit on your own. You could be free and since you weren't interacting with anyone, nobody would care or even notice that you're gone. But this won't be the future. In the future anyone who is going off the beaten path and leaves society will be reported and dealt with. There is no future for us where we are free. We will be identified with extreme prejudice and dealt with."
It's so sad that we replace socialization with this forum.,Untagged,Deleted member 7448,"Nov 20, 2020",17000,87,"Normal are constantly making memories, and those memories are almost always related to doing stuff with other people.

I tried for the past 2 days to enjoy a whole bunch of stuff: movies, anime, manga, novels, games. And they all felt so hollow.

And for example about anime ... I recalled nostalgically stuff from like 5th grade. I guess that's around the time I stopped forming memories, or at least a few years before. There was a girl in class also watching anime, and while she didn't pay any attention to me even when I liked her till 12th grade (she was kind of a nerd and a weird girl so I guess I thought I might've had a chance with her, but I never did though I'm sure she knew I liked her), I still have memories associated with watching a few anime series that she was discussing during break time, at least with others.

I watched those anime series all alone but I still am nostalgic after them because they had a social context. Because I heard others talking about them, and maybe I said a few words too (though iirc I might've kept it secret that I was watching these things).

But now I have no memories for so many years cause ... they lack social context. Even now, I can't properly enjoy things, cause it's just me consuming and forgetting once the series is over. Because there's no social investment, no emotional investment, it's just something I consumed like a bag of chips and then I forget it forever.

I guess this is why I posted so much on this forum. It felt like it gave my days a social element. Felt like posting and having these posts read by some people would give these years some sort of feeling when I recall them afterwards. Like somebody out there remembers me for who I was these few years. Cause unlike that 5th grade time when I was watching anime, for the rest of my life I'll look back to my teens and my twenties and it'll just be a blur. I won't be nostalgic after anything cause no memories were formed. My actions had no social context so they had no emotional weight, no point, no way to turn into memories.

And worst of all, I'm now an adult, and adults are supposed to already have had a bunch of social experiences, to have a social circle, and from now on for them it's just grinding at a job and starting a family and going through life with less time for friends and such. Not that it matters, I'm too avoidant and anxious to a pathological level to actually change and start socializing. I tried, it just ended up worse for me in the end."

South Korean President-elect and ""incel"", Yoon Seok-yeol

This past week, the conservative “incel” candidate Yoon Seok-yeol prevailed by a margin of less than 1% in a tight race against left-wing candidate Lee Jae-Myung, with voter turnout exceeding 77%. The South Korean president is elected via a first-past-the-post popular vote, and winners are limited to serving a single term of five years.

Foreign Policy: Deeper Engagement with the United States


Incumbent South Korean President Moon Jae-in meets Chinese President Xi Jinping

Under left-wing incumbent Moon Jae-in’s administration, South Korea’s foreign policy revolved around “strategic ambiguity”: maintain a delicate balancing act by preserving economic ties with China and military ties with the United States. In a 2021 press conference, Moon claimed that Seoul’s relationships with both Washington and Beijing are “equally important”.

To this end, Moon promised to 1) not deploy any additional THAAD missile defense systems, 2) not participate in the United States’ missile defense network, and 3) not form a trilateral military alliance with the United States and Japan (the “three No”s). He has tiptoed around discussion of China’s human rights issues, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. In terms of inter-Korean relations, Moon made regular concessions to the Kim regime, including scaling back military exercises with the United States, in a bid to formally end the Korean War, to no avail. Offering a diplomatic olive branch, Moon opened a liaison office in the border town of Kaesong in 2018; two years later, Kim Jong-Un bombed it in a show of defiance.

The left-wing candidate, Lee Jae-Myung, essentially promised to maintain Moon’s foreign policy.

President-elect Yoon will do the opposite. The conservative “incel” is hawkish and unambiguously pro-American; ditching ""strategic ambiguity"" for ""strategic clarity"". On the campaign trail, he promised to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden before any other foreign leader once elected. “South Korea has benefited from the global and regional order led by the United States,” Yoon wrote in a February 2022 article in Foreign Affairs, “A deeper alliance with Washington should be the central axis of Seoul’s foreign policy.” To that end, the incoming South Korean government intends to support the rules-based international order by aligning itself with other liberal democracies. What does that mean in practice?

To start, South Korea will plan more frequent military exercises with the United States, and assume a stronger role in the Biden administration’s Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. Yoon will also seek closer trade and intelligence ties with Japan, which many older South Koreans resent for imperialism in WWII. He will likely continue the Moon administration’s plan to join CP-TPP, but also prioritize spending on development aid and global public health, and seek participation in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (“Quad”)—an informal alliance between the U.S., Japan, Australia, and India.


The U.S. Missile Defense Agency tests the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense system, or ""THAAD""

Notably, Yoon’s foreign policy approach will be less deferential towards Pyongyang and Beijing. Criticizing Moon’s “three No” promises to China, Yoon wrote that “These pledges undercut South Korea’s sovereign right to protect its people…[South Korea] must always maintain the principled position that it will not compromise on its core security interests.” To this end, the incoming South Korean government will consider additional THAAD deployments, which would anger Beijing, as they consider THAAD a potential counter to Chinese nuclear capabilities. Yoon will also not rule out the redeployment of American nuclear weapons in South Korea, should inter-Korean tensions worsen. While he has promised to continue Moon’s program of humanitarian aid to North Korea, he would not agree to an end-of-war declaration unless North Korea denuclearizes.

While Yoon’s critics painted him as belligerent, his hawkish approach obviously resonated with South Korean voters. In the first two months of this year alone, North Korea provocatively conducted over ten ballistic missile tests.

During a presidential debate on February 25th, one day after Russia’s unjustified invasion of Ukraine, Yoon's opponent Lee Jae-Myung blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for being a “political novice” who provoked Russia by seeking ties with the West. Yoon immediately took the opportunity to emphasize the necessity of deterrence and national defense, instead of relying on the naive belief that aggressive autocrats would honor peace agreements. Yoon’s campaign followed up with a press release, noting that “[Writing the Russian invasion] off as a problem of some country on the other side of the world reflects a lack of proper understanding of international relations in the 21st century.” Although Lee later walked back his comments on Ukraine following a media backlash, the damage was done.

Domestic Policy: Countering Feminazism in South Korea

The challenges facing young South Koreans, especially men, are numerous. Soaring housing prices are crippling chances at homeownership—property prices have almost doubled in Seoul in the last five years. Income inequality is widening. Marriage rates are plummeting amongst South Korea’s working- and lower-middle-classes. South Korea’s fertility rate is 0.84 per woman, well below the population replacement rate and below the rest of the Asia-Pacific; an aging population could stunt South Korea’s long-term economic growth.

Despite strong economic growth, job competition is fierce, with youth unemployment standing at 9% as of 2021. South Korean men are obligated to serve in the military; women are not. While young men have to pause their careers for two years, young women are free to pursue internships, degrees, exchange programs and otherwise gain experience that inevitably gives them an advantage in the civilian job market over young men in their age bracket—and yet affirmative action still remains to support women.

Some of President-elect Yoon’s domestic policies are uncontroversial. Subsidized homes for first-time buyers, constructing 2.5 million additional homes, fewer corporate regulations to increase labor market flexibility, and incentivize lending to small businesses. But among his more controversial policies is his promise to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, also known as the women’s ministry, and to increase criminal penalties against those who lie about sexual assault.

Unsurprisingly, Yoon’s SJW opponents describe him in near-hysterical terms. “If Yoon Seok-yeol does prevail on 9 March…that will be an ominous sign for South Korea’s future,” writes Korean-American male feminist S. Nathan Park, on UnHerd. Young South Korean men have turned towards “aggressive misogyny and anti-feminism”, he continues, describing the presidential race as an “incel election”. “The 2022 presidential election is our most misogynistic in history,” says Haein Shim, spokeswoman of the Seoul-based feminist group Haeil, in an interview with VICE. “The presidential election is turning into a competition to determine who hates and discriminates against women the most,” according to another feminist interviewee.

Harvardcel Lee Jun-Seok speaks at a campaign event

Much of the feminist vitriol directed against South Korea’s conservatives is targeted against Lee Jun-Seok (no relation to Lee Jae-Myung), the leader of South Korea’s predominant conservative party and one of Yoon’s close allies and strongest ideological influences. Lee Jun-Seok, also labeled as an “incel”, is 5’8 and single. He is also a former venture capitalist who studied at Harvard College on a full scholarship, graduating with a double concentration in economics and computer science. At the age of 36, Lee Jun-Seok is too young for the South Korean presidency, but his sizeable bloc of antifeminist supporters is valuable for Yoon and has made him a bogeyman of the left. The conservative party’s young boss [is] a hero for internet misogynists,” screams a subheadline in an article by the left-leaning journalist Kim Arin, after Lee Jun-Seok described feminism as ""blowfish poison"".


Yoon Seok-youl and his wife, Kim Kun-hee

Yoon’s platform may not conform to the progressive orthodoxy, but there exists no indication that he is an “incel” or even “blackpilled”. Indeed, he is married, but when have facts ever gotten in the way of SJWs’ logic?

The ""Incel"" Receives a Warm Welcome

For foreign and economic policy wonks, the “incel” victory in this week’s election is an undeniably positive development for Washington’s strategic interests.


U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class and ROK Navy Sejong the Great-class guided-missile destroyers conduct a manoeuvring exercise

The Washington Post’s liberal-leaning Editorial Board sang South Korea’s praises: “A welcome turn toward the U.S.” A similar sentiment was expressed by the Wall Street Journal’s conservative-leaning Editorial Board: “An opportunity for closer security ties between Seoul and Washington.”

Absolutely. Bringing in South Korea, a rising regional power, as a stalwart and committed ally would not only further the U.S. State Department’s diplomatic initiatives in Southeast Asia, but also assist the United States Navy’s burden of securing the Indo-Pacific waters, especially if continued Russian aggression requires an American pivot to Europe. U.S. President Joe Biden has already called and invited Yoon, the ""incel"", to visit Washington later this year; U.S.-South Korea ties are the “linchpin for peace, security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific,” according to a statement by the White House.

American diplomats “are breathing a sigh of relief at Yoon’s victory,” according to Professor Lee Sung-Yoon, who is a North Korea expert at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and a former Research Associate at the Korea Institute of Harvard University and has testified before the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee.

The incoming “incel” government will likely benefit South Korea’s other partners as well. “[Yoon’s victory] bodes well for expanding Australia-South Korea economic relations,” writes Professor Gordon Flake of the Perth USAsia Centre at the University of Western Australia. “When it comes to foreign and security issues, it is obvious that Japan holds more visions in common with Mr. Yoon,” says Professor Yuki Asaba, who teaches Korean Studies at Doshisha University in Kyoto.

Here’s the billion-won question: why do these uninformed Redditards and Twittercucks so vehemently oppose President-elect Yoon Seok-yeol, who would align the South Korean people with the free world and strengthen the United States’ position in the Asia-Pacific?



Is it because they hate America and the West? Probably. We can glean from their extremely hostile attitude towards freedom of speech and due process that many r/IncelTear members adopt a political philosophy that aligns closer to the likes of Xi, Putin, and Kim; instead of Locke, Mill, or Rawls. But there is also another explanation at play: Incelophobia Derangement Syndrome.

Those who suffer from IDS cannot help but view public policy through a lens as shallow and myopic as possible: that is, “MiSogYNy”. If you don’t conform to the progressive orthodoxy, you’re part of the “other”, you’re an evil that must be banished. If you even dare suggest that women are privileged, which they are, you’re an incel. Even if you’re a man who’s been married for a decade. Additionally, IDS-positive SJWs are a single-issue group who ignore incredibly pressing issues in order to preserve femoid privilege: who cares about foreign policy, the economy, or the nuclear-armed menace to the north?

Although SJWs frequently and baselessly accuse the incel community of racism, their condescending attitude towards South Korean society and voters is on full display. The last thing that any South Korean who lives under the threat of nuclear annihilation needs is for an obese, pink-haired feminazi in suburban America to lecture them on gender equality. South Koreans are not “crybabies”; they are an intelligent, cultured, and hardworking people who do not need soy-guzzling Redditors on the other side of the world to tell them how to vote. These Redditors’ attitudes are fundamentally patronizing and hypocritical.

The South Korean people voted for a deeper strategic partnership with Washington and other allies, and a rejection of radical feminism. This is truly a welcome and exciting development.

-Taken from: ""The republic of Plato"" book.

My take is that guys like us can't find a realistic ending that would be worth striving for. That demoralizes us and prevents us from any real attempt of self improvement or doing anything because we know the outcome. Normal people tend to leave everything to a chance and live carelessly. They are copers, dreamers and useless fools who never realize their goals because their goals are not realistic nor do they follow the steps required to realize them.

Ugly face of crime: too ugly to get a job,Blackpill,Raper,"May 1, 2018",31000,77,"http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/02/im_too_ugly_to_.html

""I'm too ugly to get a job."" -- Daniel Gallagher, a Miami bank robber, after police captured him in 2003

...Not only are physically unattractive teenagers likely to be stay-at-homes on prom night, they're also more likely to grow up to be criminals, say two economists... ""We find that unattractive individuals commit more crime in comparison to average-looking ones, and very attractive individuals commit less crime in comparison to those who are average-looking,"" claim Naci Mocan of the University of Colorado and Erdal Tekin of Georgia State University... Cute guys were uniformly less likely than averages would indicate to have committed seven crimes including burglary and selling drugs, while the unhandsome were consistently more likely to have broken the law... controlling for ... characteristics known to be associated with criminal behavior.

Mocan and Tekin aren't sure why criminals tend to be ugly. Other studies have shown that unattractive men and women are less likely to be hired, and that they earn less money, than the better-looking. Such inferior circumstances may steer some to crime, Mocan and Tekin suggest. They also report that more attractive students have better grades and more polished social skills, which means they graduate with a greater chance of staying out of trouble."

 Blind women care about looks as much as sight women
 Bind women care about looks MORE than blind men
 Blind women report wanting an attractive partner for their social appearance/standing

""Our sample consisted of 94 sighted and blind participants with different ages of blindness onset: 19 blind/28 sighted males and 19 blind/28 sighted females.

[...] while physical attractiveness was less important to blind men, blind women considered physical attractiveness as important as sighted women.
The importance of a high status and likeable personality was not influenced by sightedness.""

""While blind men placed less importance on physical attractiveness, blind women did not differ from sighted women. This suggests that a partner’s physical attractiveness might bear an indirect advantage to women by increasing their desirability, while sighted men assess physical attractiveness as a direct indicator for fertility and health.""






 The study also cites a previous study that found that blind men care less about looks than blind women




""Thus far, however, only one study has quantitatively investigated sex differences in the physical and nonphysical aspects of mate preferences between sighted and blind individuals (Hasenkamp, Kümmerling, & Hassebrauck, 2005), in stark contrast to decades worth of research into this topic in the sighted.

In their study, Hasenkamp et al. examined the importance of physical attractiveness and resource acquisition in potential romantic partners in congenitally blind and sighted individuals. Results showed that physical attractiveness and resource acquisition were valued less by blind men in comparison to sighted men.

Blind women, on the other hand, exhibited a stronger preference for physical attractiveness than blind men. 
The importance of status and resource acquisition was overall lower for congenitally blind than for sighted individuals, independent of their sex.""

""As having a physically attractive partner increases an individual’s own attractiveness (Little et al., 2011), this might yield a benefit by appearing more attractive to others and might therefore explain why both blind and sighted women considered physical attractiveness equally important.

From http://judgybitch.com/2016/08/16/reblog-research-find-that-as-a-group-only-men-pay-tax/

Data from a New Zealand report shows that women uses more welfare resources than they are supplying, this leeching is made possible by male funding where men pays much more taxes and uses less of the welfare system.


Page Cannot be Found



This figure from the report shows the economic impact over time by gender. When you're a kid and when you're retired you don't work so obviously your impact is gonna be negative, but at working age the man is greatly contributing at all time while the woman is still costing money for most part. A woman is only cost efficient from age 45-60 and during that time a man still outperforms her by at least 3 times.






This shows the whole cumulative impact, in the previous figure the effective impact is shown for each age and then reset while in this all previous contributions accumulates and are counted for so that you can see the total lifetime sum. The woman is a burden her entire life and at age 80 the cost difference between them is $150.000!





Research from Sweden shows similar results, the article How welfare services are used and redistributes the households economical resources, that is based on a government report, finds that ""The net cost difference between the genders is 3.7 million kronor""(Appendix 6 on page 10) which is about 400k usd, more than double of what was shown in NZ. That means that a woman in Sweden on average gets $400.000 from men during her life!!

[MULTIPLE STUDIES] Juggernaut law confirmed. Ugly women are more likely to be married and have more sex partners.,Blackpill,Edmund_Kemper,"Dec 10, 2021",9000,46,"A study here shows that very unattractive women are more likely to be married by age 29 than unattractive or average women. Also, another study shows unattractive men were less likely to find a marriage partner than other men whereas this wasn't the case for unattractive women.

In the study ""Handsome Wants as Handsome Does: Physical Attractiveness and Gender Differences in Revealed Sexual Preferences"", they found that ugly men are much less likely to have sexual experience whereas ugly women were only a little less likely. Nonetheless, 76% of ugly men and 81% of ugly women reported sexual experience. Of all those who are sexually experienced, ugly women had on average, 6.03 partners compared to 5.69 partners, 5.59 partners and 5.14 partners for average, attractive and very attractive women, respectively. On the other hand, ugly men had on average, 6.01 partners compared to 6.97 partners, 7.23 partners and 9.92 partners for average men, attractive men and very attractive men, respectively.

When it proportion of partnerships in which sex occurred in the first week, this occurred for only 21% of ugly men's partnerships, compared to 24%, 23% and 29% of average, attractive and very attractive men's partnerships, respectively. On the other hand, sex happened in the first week in 19% of ugly women's partnerships, compared to 15%, 13% and 10% of average, attractive, and very attractive women's partnerships, respectively. Among ugly women, 47% of their partnerships are exclusive dating, compared to 51% for average women and 56% for both attractive and very attractive women. Among ugly men, 51% of their partnerships are exclusive dating compared to 45%, 46% and 44% of the partnerships of average, attractive, and very attractive men. Among ugly women, 27% of their partnerships are only sex, compared to 19% of average women and 18% for both attractive and very attractive women. For ugly men, 23% of their partnerships are only sex, compared to 32% for average men, 29% for attractive men and 36% for very attractive men.

Also, overweight/obese women were much more likely be only having sex (quarter of them compared to slightly less than 1 in 5 for skinny or normal weight women). They were also much less likely to be dating exclusively (slightly less than half compared to 55% and 62% of normal weight and skinny women dating exclusively, respectively). Overweight and obese women had more sex partners. On average, skinny women had 4.72 partners, compared to 5.56 for average weight women, 6.09 for overweight women and 6.33 for obese women.

This means both the hottest women and the thinnest women had the least sex partners, were the most likely to date exclusively, were the least likely to have relationships only involving sex, and were the least likely to have sex in the first week.

Here's the results:










TL;DR

This means ugliness deters men from sexual/romantic success but not women. Ugly and fat women might be less likely to date exclusively but they still do (same with overweight or obese women). But it means they focus more on sleeping around in hookups than monogamy. Ugly and fat women get more hookups and sex and sexual partners while the opposite is true for skinny women and hot women.

"[STUDY] 10% of children are the result of cuckoldry, males penises and semen have evolved with that in mind, women desire chad more during ovulation",Blackpill,Gymcelled,"Oct 10, 2020",20000,97,"SILLY INKWEL WOMEN DONT CHEAT THAT'S MISOGYNISTIC NONSENSE 

Lmao they cheat so much that we've evolved with specific adaptations that try to counteract this.

Here are 2 studies on cheating/cuckoldry, the evolution of penises, semen and more. The studies used will be linked at the bottom

1) Roughly 10% of children are the result of cuckoldry, 9% of women admit to cheating, among younger women it is 15% [1]

Other figures ranging from 2 to 30% are also found, but the average is found at around 10%, which seems plausible given the rates of cheating among women (9% on average, 15% when they're at their most fertile). Note that these are just admissions, in reality they probably cheat even more




It is often suggested that 10% of children are not biologically related to their putative genetic fathers as a result of cuckoldry. Anderson (2006) distinguished between studies of high and low paternity confidence samples, and found median rates of actual non-paternity (determined from blood or DNA exclusion tests) of 2% and 30% respectively, with much variability across studies.

This was supported by fairly high rates of extra-marital affairs in both men and women. In a recent study of a random sample of 9,852 Norwegians aged 18 to 49, 16% of men and 11% of women admitted to having had an affair during their current relationship, with 50% not using any form of contraception (Traeen et al, 2007). Cuckoldry is a real risk to men's reproductive fitness, sperm competition may account for certain sex differences in human psychology and morphology. For example, prevalence estimates of offspring from extra-pair copulations range from I% to 30% across cultures, averaging around 10(% (Shackelford et al., 2005). Jolmson et al. (2001) also found that 9% of all women and 15% of women between the ages of 16 and 24 years reported having concurrent sexual relationships and' Gallup et al. (2006) reported 25% of women in an institution to engage in extra-pair copulation.

2) Alpha fucks, beta bucks + Women desire chad MORE after having found a beta buxxer, they like chad more as time goes on and lose interest in their husband over time [1]




Psychologically, women are hardwired differently than men, A woman has a dual sex drive. The first is centered on finding a mate for life to help support her and her offspring. This is why (and when) love is such an important part of a woman's sexual desire, The second is a desire to obtain a variety of the best genetic material to produce the best children.

Click to expand...


Doesn't this read like some blackpill straight out of an incel forum? Jfl it's exactly alpha fucks, beta bucks. But things get even more brutal




This second desire begins to grow once a woman has found her life mate and grows stronger as time with him progresses. Eventually, this latter and more powerful drive overpowers her sexual desire for her life mate. This is why a woman's sexual desire for her husband diminishes over time

Click to expand...


THAT'S RIGHT. WOMEN DESIRE CHAD EVEN MORE WHEN THEY'VE FOUND THEIR BETABUXXER OR HAVE SETTLED DOWN  THERE'S LITERALLY NO ESCAPE: WOMEN ARE CHADSEXUAL




At the same time, her sexual desire for other men is increasing. This does not make her immoral or mean that she no longer loves her husband. It is simply part of her genetic code (Susan, 2011), Compounding this is that, nature has not only given women a two prong and exponentially stronger sex drive than men, it has also given women the ability to experience a far greater quantity, intensity, and variety of sexual pleasure and orgasm than men. This is nature's way of motivating a woman to seek out sexual activity considering the risk she bears in doing so

""Women have a low sex drive bro  my wife is not very sexual, that's why we only have sex 3 times per year with the lights off""

3) Women cheat or fantasize about cheating the most during ovulation, when they're at their most fertile [1]




In fact, women in particular, as a group, show systematic changes in sexual fantasy and attractiveness to extra-pair men, among other sex-related traits, around the time of ovulation (Macrae et al., 2002). Women are not only more likely to fantasize about and sometimes engage in an affair during this time, they are also more sensitive to and attracted by male pheromones (Gangestad et al., 2002).

Click to expand...


That's right, when their body is ready to have a baby is when they want chad the most and forget about their non chad betabuxxing husband.




Baker and Bellis (1990) found that when women initiated an infidelity it often occurred around the time of ovulation and 7% of the copulations during this time of ovulation were with an extra-pair man, and these relationships were less likely to involve the use of contraceptives than were copulations with their social partner

Click to expand...


Women are even less likely to use contraceptives when cheating at their most fertile jfl, they actively want to get pregnant with chad

4) Women are even more attracted to chad during ovulation than during normal times [1]




Thornhill and Gangestad, (1999) found that the scent of facially symmetric and thus physically attractive men was rated as more attractive and sexy than was the scent of less symmetric men, but only during this fertile time frame. Penton-Voak and Perret (2000) found that women rate masculine faces, those with a more prominent jaw, as especially attractive around the time of ovulation. Scent, facial symmetry, and a masculine jaw bone may, in turn, be proximate cues to the man's genetic fitness and social dominance (Shackelford and Larsen, 1997)

5) The size (dickpill) and shape of the human penis is designed to remove the semen of other men, semen is designed to stick as best as possible and stop the semen from other men [2]




In addition to the ostensible impact of female choice on the evolution of more elaborate male genitalia (Eberhard, 1996), there is reason to believe that sperm competition played a role in shaping the human penis. The human penis, with a relatively larger glans and more pronounced coronal ridge than is found in many other primates, may function to displace seminal fluid from rival males in the vagina by forcing it back over/under the glans.

Click to expand...





During intercourse the effect of repeated thrusting would be to draw out and displace foreign semen away from the cervix. As a consequence, if a female copulated with more than one male within a short period of time this would allow subsequent males to “scoop out” semen deposited by others before ejaculating (Baker and Bellis, 1995).

Click to expand...





To test this hypothesis, Gallup, Burch, Zappieri, Parvez, Stockwell, and Davis (2003) simulated sexual encounters using artificial models and measured the magnitude of artificial semen displacement as a function of phallus configuration, depth of thrusting, and semen viscosity. The displacement of simulated semen was robust across different prosthetic phalluses, different artificial vaginas, different semen recipes, and different semen viscosities. The magnitude of semen displacement was directly proportional to the depth of thrusting and inversely proportional to semen viscosity. By manipulating different characteristics of artificial phalluses, the coronal ridge and frenulum were identified as key morphological features involved in mediating the semen displacement effect. 

Click to expand...


Brutal dickpill incoming: bigger penises are functionally more efficient at removing sperm. We've evolved with bigger penises than every other primate because we needed to counteract cheating. Even the shape is designed for that




In order for the human penis to serve as an efficient semen displacement device, it needs to be of sufficient size to fill the vagina and supplant foreign semen In contrast with our closest living relative, the human penis is roughly twice as long and wide as that of the common chimpanzee (Short, 1980).

Click to expand...





As evidence that the human penis may have been shaped by the recurrent adaptive problem posed by sperm competition consider the following. Magnetic resonance imaging studies show that during coitus, the typical penis fills and expands the human vagina, and with complete penetration often pushes up against the cervix (Weijmar Schultz, van Andel, Sabelis, and Mooyart, 1999). When ejaculation occurs, thrusting diminishes and vaginal penetration reaches its maximum point (Masters and Johnson, 1966). Not only does this serve to release semen in close proximity to the cervix, but data on ejaculatory pressure shows that the first several ejaculatory contractions project seminal fluid with such force that it can be expelled at a distance of 30-60cm if not contained in a vagina (Masters and Johnson, 1966)

Click to expand...


A longer dick allows you to push your semen deeper and remove other semen effectively




Thus, there appear to have been a series of adaptations that serve to confine or focus the release of semen to the uppermost portion of the vaginal tract, possibly as a means of making it less vulnerable to displacement by other males. A longer penis would not only have been an advantage for leaving semen in a less accessible part of the vagina, but by filling and expanding the vagina it also would aid and abet the displacement of semen left by other males as a means of maximizing the likelihood of paternity.

Click to expand...


6) Chad has better semen because frequent semen release improves its coagulation [2]

First of all let's establish the benefits of semen coagulation when it comes to reproduction




Semen coagulates within seconds after ejaculation and then liquefies or decoagulates about 15-30 minutes later (Mandal and Bhattacharyya, 1985; Robert and Gagnon, 1999). While semen hyperviscosity is associated with infertility (Gonzales, Kortebani and Mazzolli, 1993), the first part of the ejaculate does not typically coagulate, only the last fraction (Baker and Bellis, 1995). Baker and Bellis speculate that this keeps the semen in place while sperm travel to the cervix, and at the same time prevents the passage of rival sperm from subsequent males.

Click to expand...





The data derived from artificial genitals (Gallup et al., 2003) also show that viscous semen is more difficult to displace, and as a consequence another function of semen coagulation may be to minimize self-semen displacement and/or displacement by other males.

Click to expand...





Mandel and Bhattacharyya (1986) measured semen coagulation in humans, and found that if the male had not ejaculated in the previous two days liquefication times were significantly decreased. Thus, by implication, men who copulate frequently (which may include multi-partner matings) deposit semen that coagulates for longer periods of time. 

Click to expand...


Chad wins at life in every way and even wins at creating life jfl

7) Our semen coagulation time is yet an other indication of women's propensity to cheat [2]




Dixon and Anderson (2002) examined semen coagulation and copulatory plugs in 40 species of primates. Coagulation rates were highest in species where females commonly mate with multiple partners, and lowest in those where females are primarily monogamous or belong to polygynous groups.

Well, it turns out, that inexperienced men don't typically do that. they have lower physical standards. Link to study here.

110 volunteers with 47 male and 63 female (mean age=22.36 years, SD=3.64) (the vast majority of them were heterosexual) participated in this study.



In the framework of the “Tinder” task, participants indicated their romantic and sexual interest in a first step. Therefore, they were asked in which gender they are primarily interested in (opposite gender: Nmales = 45 and Nfemales = 61; same gender: Nmales = 2 and Nfemales = 2; notably, we avoided the terms hetero-, homo- and bisexual at this point since this item was to determine whether pictures of men or women were shown subsequently). Depending on their answer, they were then shown pictures of either 40 female or 40 male medium attractive faces. On 20 pictures, participants indicated their romantic interest. This involved three items to be answered on a 1 = not at all to 6 = very much response scale (“I would like to take up contact with this person to get to know her/him romantically”, “I would like to arrange a romantic date with this person”, “I would like to meet this person on a romantic date”; α = 0.95). On the other 20 pictures, participants indicated their sexual interest. Therefore, they responded to the same three items as before; however, the word “romantic” was replaced with the word “sexual” (α = 0.97). Which of the 40 pictures were shown for the romantic and sexual category was randomized across participants, as well as the order in which they were shown.

Next paragraph right below but read this: according to the methodology, they wanted to use average-looking people because it's the best way to measure how high a person's standards can be (because many people get attracted to conventionally attractive people but not many like ugly people. Apparently, women are more conventionally attractive than men on average:



The stimulus materials for the “Tinder” task was created as follows: A total of 271 pictures of friendly-looking faces was pretested for their level of attractivity. These pictures were obtained from a social media platform to appear as naturally as possible. Thirty-one participants indicated how attractive they experienced each of the depicted persons on a 1 = not at all to 8 = very much response scale. Those 80 pictures which ranged most closely around the mean were chosen for the OT study (male: M = 2.91, SD = 0.90, Min = 1.33, Max = 5.40; female: M = 3.63, SD = 0.90, Min = 1.81, Max = 5.63).

In the study, inexperienced men had more romantic/sexual interest in a woman with medium physical attractiveness. Oxytocin made inexperienced men more selective. Inexperienced men were more romantically interested in medium attractiveness women than experienced men. In other words, they were less selective than experienced men. With oxytocin, inexperienced men were only slightly less interested romantically in medium attractiveness women than experienced men (in other words: only slightly more selective). When it came to romantic interest, oxytocin made both experienced and inexperienced men more selective, especially inexperienced men. It reduced romantic interest for both types of men, especially inexperienced men. Inexperienced men had more sexual interest in medium attractiveness women than experienced men, but less sexual interest in medium attractiveness women than experienced men when the men all were taking oxytocin. Oxytocin reduced sexual interest in inexperienced men but did not affect sexual interest in experienced men. In short, inexperienced men are less selective than experienced men, but are slightly more selective and officially more selective than experienced men when it comes to oxytocin. Inexperienced men have their romantic/sexual interest reduced with oxytocin.

On the other hand, inexperienced women were slightly less romantically interested in medium-attractiveness men than experienced women, therefore slightly more picky than experienced women. Under oxytocin, however, they were officially more romantically interested in medium attractiveness men than experienced women (AKA less selective than experienced women). Oxytocin increased romantic interest in inexperienced women but decreased romantic interest in experienced women. When it came to sexual interest, they were a little less sexually interested in medium attractiveness men than experienced women (AKA a little pickier than experienced women), but officially more sexually interested in medium attractiveness men than experienced women when both were under oxytocin (AKA less picky than experienced women). Oxytocin reduced sexual interest in experienced women but slightly increased sexual interest in inexperienced women. In short, inexperienced women are a little pickier than experienced women romantically/sexually but less picky than experienced women romantically/sexually when it comes oxytocin. Oxytocin increased interest levels in inexperienced women but reduced interest levels in experienced women.

Men had more romantic interest in average looking women than women did in average looking men (although inexperienced women but not experienced women had just as much romantic interest as men in average-looking people of the opposite sex). When it came to sexual interest, both experienced men and inexperienced men were both more sexually interested in the opposite sex's average looking women than women (both experienced and inexperienced) were sexually interested in average-looking men regardless of oxytocin.

TL;DR SUMMARY

In short, inexperienced men have lower physical standards than experienced men (both sexually and romantically), but when under oxytocin, their romantic physical standards were slightly higher than experienced men's when it came to romantic interest and officially higher than experienced men's when it came to sexual interest. Oxytocin raised inexperienced men's physical standards romantically and sexually, but only raised experienced men's romantic physical standards (although it raised inexperienced men's romantic physical standards even more). Inexperienced women had slightly higher physically standards romantically/sexually than experienced women but are less picky with their physical standards romantically/sexually than experienced women under oxytocin. Oxytocin reduced inexperienced women's romantic standards but only slightly reduced her sexual standards, whereas it increased experienced women's both sexual and romantic standards.

So this idea that male involuntary celibates chase women outta their league? It's a myth. Quite the opposite actually.

MORE IMPORTANT DATA




Men show more romantic interest and sexual interest in average looking people of the opposite sex than women, regardless of oxytocin. This is shown in this table right here above.

The sample size might not be big, but this study's results are noteworthy, especially given this quote:



Promoting an appropriate form of selectiveness might be particularly adaptive for the inexperienced (men). Experienced and inexperienced individuals vary in their expectations in romantic and sexual relationships and corresponding behaviors Due to fear of failure, inexperienced individuals are especially non-selective in their dating strategy. This, however, is not adaptive to find a suitable partner, particularly in more demanding courtships in which males must discriminate between those to be courted and those to be ignored. Since OT promotes a more adaptive pair-bonding strategy, we hypothesized OT to increase selectivity particularly among the inexperienced men.

And people here, contrary to what IT say, have low physical standards.

Mimetic Desire of sexual partners is exclusive to women? 'Mate Choice Copying' has some answers,Theory,Friedrich Nietzsche,"Oct 10, 2021",6000,21,"Firstly, Mimetic desire is the reason and the concept that people want things more if others have/desire it, e.g. Bob owns a computer and James wants one, so Ian buys one despite not being that interested in anything to do with computers. The key takeaway being that people wanting things and/or having them can make others want them even if they were not initially that bothered.

Graph of rene Girard's triangular structure of desire:





Here is a YouTube video on Mimetic Desire:

The Second Concept that I want to introduce is Mate Choice Copying, which is a well known concept at least in the Incel community even if it is not called that here, what it boils down to is women finding men in relationships more attractive than men not in relationships, the reason for this is herd mentality (from what I could gather), if person A has more sexual interest from the opposite sex then there must be a reason for this, this helped women choose the best man to father her offspring. despite what most people on this forum including me might of thought it seems that men do mate choice copy, although it is definitely more pronounced in women below is a couple graphs showing it, and most academic sources portray women as the ones who do it rather than men, but we must accept reality even when it might not suit us.

According to Discover:




In a study released last week, Markus Jokela, a researcher at the University of Helsinki, found beautiful women had up to 16% more children than their plainer counterparts. He used data gathered in America, in which 1,244 women and 997 men were followed through four decades of life. Their attractiveness was assessed from photographs taken during the study, which also collected data on the number of children they had. ... One finding was that women were generally regarded by both sexes as more aesthetically appealing than men. The other was that the most attractive parents were 26% less likely to have sons. Kanazawa said: ""Physical attractiveness is a highly heritable trait, which disproportionately increases the reproductive success of daughters much more than that of sons. ""If more attractive parents have more daughters and if physical attractiveness is heritable, it logically follows that women over many generations gradually become more physically attractive on average than men.

Click to expand...

The study finds that attractive parents are more likely to have daughters and less likely to have sons. And attractive parents are more likely to give birth to children who grow up into attractive adults. This means that women are getting hotter and they are hotter than men. The study found people rated women as more physically attractive than men.

in this study, they found this:



In the framework of the “Tinder” task, participants indicated their romantic and sexual interest in a first step. Therefore, they were asked in which gender they are primarily interested in (opposite gender: Nmales=45 and Nfemales=61; same gender: Nmales=2 and Nfemales=2; notably, we avoided the terms hetero-, homo- and bisexual at this point since this item was to determine whether pictures of men or women were shown subsequently). Depending on their answer, they were then shown pictures of either 40 female or 40 male medium attractive faces. On 20 pictures, participants indicated their romantic interest. This involved three items to be answered on a 1=not at all to 6=very much response scale (“I would like to take up contact with this person to get to know her/him romantically”, “I would like to arrange a romantic date with this person”, “I would like to meet this person on a romantic date”; α=0.95). On the other 20 pictures, participants indicated their sexual interest. Therefore, they responded to the same three items as before; however, the word “romantic” was replaced with the word “sexual” (α=0.97). Which of the 40 pictures were shown for the romantic and sexual cate- gory was randomized across participants, as well as the order in which they were shown.
The stimulus materials for the “Tinder” task was created as follows: A total of 271 pictures of friendly-looking faces was pretested for their level of attractivity. These pictures were obtained from a social media platform to appear as naturally as possible. Thirty-one participants indicated how attractive they experienced each of the depicted persons on a 1=not at all to 8=very much response scale. Those 80 pictures which ranged most closely around the mean were chosen for the OT study (male: M = 2.91, SD =0.90, Min =1.33, Max=5.40; female: M=3.63, SD=0.90, Min=1.81, Max=5.63).

According to the Psychology Today article:



Earlier studies indeed show that women are on average physically more attractive than men both in Japan and in the United States. The analysis of the NCDS data replicates the sex difference in physical attractiveness in the United Kingdom.

As the following graph shows, 85.5% of girls in the NCDS sample are described by their teachers at “attractive” at age 7, whereas only 83.1% of boys are. The sex difference in the proportions described as “attractive” at age 7 is statistically significant.

Click to expand...








Similarly, 11.4% of girls in the NCDS sample are described by their teachers as “unattractive” at age 7, whereas 12.0% of boys are. The sex difference is in the predicted direction, but, due to the small number of children (both boys and girls) described as “unattractive,” the sex difference here is not statistically significant.

Click to expand...







The following two graphs show that the sex difference in physical attractiveness is similar in the United States as it is in the United Kingdom. The data come from Add Health, and physical attractiveness was measured in childhood, in junior high and high school, by an interviewer.

Click to expand...









As you can see, girls are on average physically more attractive than boys. A majority (56.03%) of the girls are either “attractive” or “very attractive,” whereas the comparable figure among boys is much lower (41.75%). In fact, a majority (51.21%) of the boys are “about average.” Nearly twice as many girls (19.53%) as boys (10.51%) are “very attractive.” It therefore appears that, both in the United Kingdom and the United States, women are indeed more physically attractive on average than men are, at least partly because beautiful parents are, and have been, more likely to have daughters.

In a study called ""The effect of aging on facial attractiveness"", women rated women's faces are more attractive than men's faces. Men also rated men's faces as more attractive than how women rated men's faces. Women also rated older women and middle aged women's faces more attractive than men did (although a slight difference for older women which was on average 39 years old).






Additionally, research has shown that not many woman are totally straight. Gay women are usually mostly aroused by their own gender compared to only a minority here and there of straight women:




Researchers asked 345 women about their sexual preferences and compared these with their arousal levels when shown videos of attractive men and women.

Click to expand...





They found 28% of straight women were mostly aroused by their preferred sex, compared with 68% of gay women.

Click to expand...





The new study, led by Dr Gerulf Rieger from the University of Essex and published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, measured the arousal of women using eye tracking devices and direct measures of physiological sexual response.
Previous studies had already suggested that straight women were aroused by both sexes when tested, but researchers had never looked at whether the same was true for gay women.

Dr Rieger said the study's conclusion that women who identified as being completely gay were much more aroused by their preferred sex was ""amazing"".
He said their sexual arousal patterns were much more similar to men, whose responses tend to very accurately mirror their stated sexual preferences.
Dr Rieger said: ""In the past we thought it was true of all women that they were aroused by both sexes. The fact that it appears this is not the case is amazing.""

Click to expand...





Dr Rieger said the wider conclusions of the study was that, while the majority of women identified as straight: ""Our research shows that, when it comes to what turns them on they are usually bisexual or gay, but never totally straight"".
However, he added the research did not necessarily mean women were repressing their true sexual preferences, but that their sexualities were simply more complex than men's.
""When it comes to straight women and sexual arousal there is such a disconnect between what a woman tells me and what her body does.
""It suggests that it's a different world for women when it comes to their sexualities.""

As always I will be sharing main TAKEAWAYS and in the end of this thread you will see the sources and link to the full PDF version of study.

“Black/White Dating Online: Interracial Courtship in the 21st Century”
Gerald A. Mendelsohn, Lindsay Shaw Taylor, Andrew T. Fiore, and Coye Cheshire
University of California, Berkeley

The goal of the current research was to further our knowledge of interracial dating by examining concurrently the stated and revealed preferences of Black and White users of a major online dating site. The study is based on a nationwide sample of more than a million participants who were seeking a date with a member of the opposite sex.

The major questions to be addressed follow:

1. To what extent do Black and White daters state an interest in dating (a) members of their own race, and (b) members of a race/ethnicity other than their own?

2. To what extent do Black and White daters initiate contact with persons of their own race and of a race/ethnicity other than their own? In particular, what are the relative rates of Black–Black, Black–White, White–White, and White–Black contacts initiated by participants?

3. To what extent do Black and White daters reciprocate contacts they have received online

Race. As part of their personal profile, users indicated their own racial/ethnic identification by selecting one from among a list of labels provided by the site. For this article, we selected only those who self-identified as African American/Black or Caucasian/White.

The Results: 
The results for stated and revealed preferences are shown in Tables 1–3.

Preferences





In sum, Whites more than Blacks and women more than men stated a preference for a partner of their own race/ethnicity. Black males were least selective in the sense that the majority of them stated no preference in regard to the race/ethnicity of a potential partner. White females, half of whom sought a partner of their own race/ethnicity, were the most selective of the four Race/Gender groups.

2-Contacts Initiated



The most striking feature of the table is the difference between the behavior of the White and the Black users. An overwhelming majority (85% for females and males combined) of the contacts initiated by Whites were to Whites and a correspondingly small percent (3%) were to Blacks.

What about users who stated no racial or ethnic preferences? Was their stated indifference to race and ethnicity reflected in their behavior? The answer for Whites is that it was not, for even among those who specified no preference, contacts to Whites predominated greatly and contacts to Blacks were at a low level irrespective of age. In contrast, a majority of the contacts initiated by Black users in the category any were to members of races or ethnicities other than their own, including Whites.

3-Percent of Contacts Reciprocated




Black users, in fact, were as a group more likely to reciprocate a message from a White person than from a Black person, White users who stated an indifference to race and ethnicity nevertheless reciprocated at a higher rate to Whites than to Blacks or others, but Blacks, both male and female whose stated preference was any reciprocated at a higher rate to Whites and others than to Blacks.

Young White individuals who stated an indifference to the race or ethnicity of a partner were, in fact, highly selective in their revealed preferences; 85% of the contacts they initiated were to Whites and 3% to Blacks. Were they hypocritical, alert to the realities of the social world, striving for political correctness, attempting an optimizing strategy of self-presentation?


The Conclusion

We analyzed personal profiles and records of communication for more than a million nationwide users of a major online dating site. Overall, Blacks, especially Black men, proved more open to cross-race dating than did Whites. More than 80% of the contacts initiated by Whites were to Whites, with only 3% to Blacks. This sharp difference held for men and women and even for those who stated no racial or ethnic preference in their profiles. Blacks were 10 times more likely to contact Whites than Whites were to contact Blacks.

There was, however, an inconsistency between stated and revealed preferences for women: Women who stated no preference in regard to race/ethnicity nevertheless revealed in their behavior a strong same-race/ethnicity preference.

Together, the above studies suggest that (1) individuals’ decisions about who interests them as a potential date are strongly influenced by considerations of race/ethnicity, and (2) what individuals say they want can differ from what their behavior reveals about their preferences. This distinction between stated and revealed preferences will be of central concern in the current research.

To summarize, on both measures of revealed preference, Black users showed more interest in cross-race dating than did White users. This was the case for men and women, for the young and even for those (in the category any) whose stated preferences indicated an indifference to a partner’s ethnicity

"""Incel"" who wanted to ""blow up hot cheerleaders"" was in fact a normie with a girlfriend (FBI documents enclosed)",Blackpill,PPEcel,"Jun 24, 2021",12000,47,"I've been following Cole Carini's case for a year now. He was originally scheduled to be sentenced tomorrow (June 25th), but just a few hours ago, the judge agreed to delay sentencing since one of the government's witnesses that was scheduled to testify, a forensic examiner at the FBI laboratory in Quantico, is otherwise occupied investigating another incident.

Anyways, here's what I know so far.

Documents not otherwise linked are in the appendix.

_____________________________________________________________________________

Background

In June 2020, Carini shows up at a hospital in Richlands, VA with extensive injuries to his hands and shrapnel wounds. He tells law enforcement that he suffered the injuries during a lawnmower accident. After a search warrant is executed, local, state, and federal law enforcement find a significant amount of TATP, a highly volatile primary explosive, in his residence. They also found drawings of explosive devices, a partially constructed pressure cooker bomb, and a scrap of paper containing one of Carini's unhinged writings. The words Elliot Rodger and hot cheerleaders were mentioned (a photo of this scrap of paper can be found on page 7 of the U.S. government's sentencing memorandum appended below).

On Buzzfeed, the Daily Beast, and on Reddit, that was all it took to declare Carini an incel. Here is the initial affidavit for reference.

Carini is later indicted on one count of making false statements to the FBI and one count of manufacturing and possessing a destructive device.

In December 2020, Carini agrees to plead guilty to Count 2. (Plea agreement here; Department of Justice press release here)


Latest information

During the investigation, it becomes clear that there is no evidence that Carini had ties to any incel communities, was motivated by incel philosophy, or self-identified as an incel. It turns out Carini is merely a failed white normie who also happens to be autistic and severely mentally ill. In fact, Carini had a girlfriend, ""Jamie Keen"", and even briefly maintained ties to her even after his arrest. According to prosecutors, Keen was in fact well aware of Carini's attempts to manufacture explosives and even talked about mailing drug-laced letters to Carini in jail.

This information can be gleaned from an FBI tactical intelligence report and an FBI laboratory report on Carini's explosives.

There is also more information about Carini's school and home life from the defense's sentencing memorandum, which reinforces my impression that he is a failed normie (considering he was a 6ft+ cumskin) and not a blackpiller.

Women and individual selective traits.,Based,To_Live_is to_Serve,"Jul 5, 2020",13000,35,"This post contains segments from my earlier posts so that I don't have to link to them. 
This is my master-post about these subjects and you may want to bookmark it even if or because it is a bit of a wall of text.



Part 1: Individual selective traits

Individual selective traits are traits which are favourable to the individual but unfavourable to the group. Cowardice, deception, selfishness and the dark triad of personality belongs here. Group selective traits are traits which are favourable to the group but not the individual. Mercy, compassion, conscience, self sacrifice, truthfulness and unselfishness belong to those. Note that the latter correlate with conventional morals which are taught even if individual selective traits may also be favourable in a sheer evolutionary sense. Intelligence correlates with group selective traits and morals even if there are exceptions and it does not lie among them itself.

Humans compete as individuals and groups. Individual selective traits are beneficial regarding individual competition and group selective traits are beneficial regarding competition between groups. An-prim tribes are often merciless to rival tribes but cunning or self sacrificing within the tribe. They would get steamrolled by a larger more group selective group which is what happened during the period of colonisation. The natives of Papua new guinea don't know about salt water if their territory is separated from the sea by more than one territory. Such a society would not have a chance against a civilised colonial empire.

A pattern is that individual selective traits increase when a group is isolated at peace until the group selective traits have become so weak that the group is taken over and genocided by a group which is earlier in the cycle and more group selective. Individual competition and group competition keep these that is at a balance that is competitive in the ecology of residence. 

99% of humans are selectively moral and immoral depending on the circumstances. Humans are much more group selective than most plants and animals.
The hyper social insects like ants and bees are extremely group selective. Most of them are sterile and their genetic survival depends on the survival of the clan.

It is an individual selective trait to hoard for yourself at the expense of the group while it is a group selective trait to abstain so that there is more left for others.
Too much group or individual selective traits can be bad. 
If everyone leaves the firewood for everyone else, all of it would be wasted. 
A rule that everyone has to burn a set amount of firewood would have to be instated. 
If anyone hoarded all the firewood, that person would be warm but the other people in town would freeze while most of the firewood rotted. 
A rule that distributed the firewood equally would have to be instated.
If you want to inhibit individual selective traits, you would have to make a rule that says people can eat 3 apples each as most.
If you want to inhibit group selective traits, you would have to make a rule that says everyone must eat 1 apple or more.

Most western stories have some sort of group selective moral such as if the protagonist gives to charity instead of being selfish and for his good intentions is gifted a chest of gold which he for some reason keeps for himself while the antagonist steals for himself and later is hurt which in postum justifies that he aquired resources for himself as compensation. There is not even a story about someone who kills all old people but then ages and becomes the only old person in the world before a new generation of aged people ages to its place which would be ironic. The antagonist may be based on our innate harsh individual selective traits as shown by the quote ""A good antagonist thinks he's right; a great antagonist is right"". It may be moral to perform individual selective actions, especially as a group selective person among individual selective people, ie a nice guy.

There is an abundance if group / individual selective behaviour in different parts of the world. 
I've noticed that there is a lack of good deeds to perform in Sweden where I live now. The most obvious thing is to be charitable. 
The big charities are alienating and corrupt; they contribute to things like feminism and over population in Africa.
The small number of native beggars have been displaced by violent gangs of criminal gypsies from continental Europe. All that is given to them goes to the wealthy bosses who hold the beggars as captives. They would return and get real jobs in Romania where most of them are from if everyone stopped giving them money for 2 months. The police recommended doing this some years after the popular consensus supported this but the criminal captives are still in front of every store.

Group selective people tend to have a sense of noblesse oblige and view positions of power as a burden with accompanying responsibilities, especially when they occupy them themselves. Individual selective people such as women and low IQ groups tend to instead just use it as a means to harm those below them and demand the utmost best treatment from their subjects while not working themselves. Women in positions of power may demand that men humiliate themselves and submit like a beta to them in order to do their profession bound service.

Torturing people and animals to death for fun is an individual selective trait. 
There are people in Africa and Central America who torture and kill people recreationally. The Americans often video tape it so that you can watch it on gore sites.
There is an abundance of individual selective traits in these places which is why they are third world prisons of people who want to go to the Germanic countries.
It appears that a country benefits from self sacrificing nice guys even if it is a burden to be one on an individual level.

Being a nice guy often means being taken advantage of. To be beaten and forced into introversion which nobody is born with is not uncommon. Nice guys may finish last but a truly group selective person would as an end game have, not egoistic individual success, but the success of the group, nation or the whole world.
Many great geniuses like Newton and Tesla were volcels during the latter halves of their lives and many others were forced into inceldom.
It is possible to be too smart for women; more on that further down.
Big thinkers like Nietzsche, Socrates, Aristotle, Confucius and others appear to in unison agree that women are essentially inferior to men and should be in a position of servitude, early arranged marriages and not high studies or positions of authority.

It appears as if humans have evolved from individual selective low IQ entities due to our behaviour. There were only 1 million humans on earth during most of the stone age and they had an average IQ of around 70. The conclusion can also be deduced from the behaviour of different types of humans.
The moral person who abstains for the sake of others has an inner temptation to grab for itself and understands why those of lesser qualities wants to acquire for themselves. The understanding of the other is not mutual. The immoral often attributes weakness or stupidity to those who leave resources like women and food for the rest; they don't attribute it to a different endgame, an endgame that favours the group more than the individual. They don't have the part of the mind that compels others to be self sacrificing; they are not chained to their behaviour as the generous and compassionate is chained away from its primal instincts to eat all the food, bed all the women and hoard all the firewood. 

The individual selective person would be chained to its egoistic behaviour while being tempted to leave resources for others if the group selective compassionate ones were the archaic and humans were derived from people of purely group selective inclinations. The group selective would then not have or need inner chains to keep them to their often genetically predestined behaviour. Perhaps they would then not attribute individual selective behaviour to an endgame that favours the individual over the group but to ignorance and stupidity as their counterparts do in this world. They would not have a primitive core of will to take for themselves, just one that without compulsion makes them help their peers.



Part 2: Malevolence among females

Imagine working for a female boss who lacks a sense of truth and morals, sensing only dominance and hierarchy. She would penalise you for correcting her regardless of who was right and who was wrong. You would not be successful in speaking about it to your female coworkers if they act reflexively without the weight on language.
They would reflexively penalise you if you stopped acting reflexively. It would be like a dog that could not communicate its discovery to other dogs, being penalised for trying to get their attention. It must be under such circumstances human dominance instincts developed, that is, before language. It would not be good to work with females as they can act like this.
Chad may get a pass and he doesn't have to work with them to speak to them or be touched.

The adult human female has 10% less brain volume than the adult human male who has 10% larger brain. People with low calorie brain outsource their thinking to others. Women are often in groups with an alpha female who may compete for followers with other Alpha females or penalise disobedience and disloyalty among her subjects. The alpha female is often among the oldest if not the oldest in the group.
Said leader may need to be a bit smart to keep her followers. Anyone who knows something she doesn't is a threat to her; anyone who is more intelligent and analytical than her is an even greater threat. A man who is more intelligent than her and has integrity to tell the truth cannot be allowed close to her subjects. She penalises that type of men for approaching, making her subjects dislike him, making him know it and paring her subjects up with men of lesser intelligence, men she can control or at least understand and predict. This type of woman typically also has a great deal of misandry and crab mentality. 
The alpha female speaks for all females. An alpha female could say that all women want something without asking the others and the others would follow. 
Women often fail to do this with men as men unlike women have a greater sense of being equal but different individuals.

Women, as I have written above, have smaller less productive brains than men; adult human males have about 10% larger brains than their female counterparts, most notably larger frontal lobe. The frontal lobe is the part of the brain responsible for logic, analysing, self control, inhibition, advanced thinking and as an extension morals, especially higher morals. The frontal lobe is inactive when you sleep along with the part of the brain responsible for long term memory and sense of time. This is why dreams which are only up to 2 minutes long appear to be absurd without you noticing it, being forgotten and their beginning never being remembered. You don't notice the irrationality of your dreams because the frontal lobe is inactive.

The inferior brain of females means that they outsource their thinking and opinion forming to other females in the group. The opinions of a group of females is the average with regards to their strength; the opinion of the alpha female weighs the heaviest. A normal woman will average the opinion of the alpha female and herself and make that her opinion. Jeffery Epstein had a female Jewish helper who spoke to the boys, girls and teen women he brought to his island.
Her loyalty lied not with females against males but with Mossad and the Jews. She adamantly said that the young women should do the sexual things and they averaged their opinions with hers multiple times until they had become hers as she never conceded, a trait of someone who is sure of what it's doing, something females respond to. They respond to females, alpha females, authority figures and primal punishment, besides their instincts.

There is a way to act that is acted by normies, women, low IQ people and men.
It is a system in which non-platonic friendship is impossible unless you're equally subjugated by someone else. If you beat them like a bad dog or slander them at their every attempt at forming their own opinion or do something without your permission they treat you as their master like said dog. If you treat them like an equal, they will try to dominate you and tell you what to do while immorally attacking you for doing your own thing in your half of the living space. There can be a third person who dominates you both and tells you what to think so that you can outsource your thinking to that person if you are low IQ and your brain burns fewer calories per day than mine. They will then treat you as an equal as neither of you dominates the other and tells it what to do and what to think. Women have no qualms about asking the leader of their girl gang what to think, even about important issues such as what to vote for. They don't have the same sense of truth or morality as men; they may think it a virtue to be able to be told what is true and moral without a sense of a potentially conflicting objective reality.

It is a known meme, particularly among MGTOWs that the house belongs to the woman while the male provider must make do with a corner in the garage or a bathroom he can lock himself into. Women often steal clothes and other ornaments they don't like from their men which they can while men cannot do the same as women projecting keep track of every possession instead of contributing to society like a group selective person. Women don't care about producing like a group selective person but mostly about acquiring and having in relation to others like the individual selective people they are.

A woman would be like a dog or a sheep if you could dominate her totally but if there were other women who competed to take your place, they would all hate you openly among themselves. The latter scenario is unlikely to happen as the women would gang up and make one of their own their leader above all men.
They often don't see men as persons who's thoughts and space to respect but an entity to avoid, control or make obedient.

Integrity means to tell the truth and have honour when it isn't in your social or material interest. To have integrity, it is needed to have a sense of truth, logic and morals, a task women as a group are not very good at due to their smaller frontal lobes. A person with no sense of truth, logic or morals at all that could only sense loyalty and primal hierarchy would have an archetypal female mind. That person would believe its gang leader whatever it said and make up the utmost absurdities if it was such a leader itself. 
A complete person with a complete mind would understand your lawn from his even if you didn't pose on the borders all the time or made symbolic minor intrusions to his. The opposite person would instead of investing in a pastime or a craft intrude on your land, living space, dignity, feelings, norms and everything else of yours unless you would mark your territory which you with regards to women don't have the right to do in practice. 
To spend time on advancing socially and to gain sexually is an individual selective trait while to provide and improve the world instead of working on your social or sexual status is group selective. Women often act reflexively without a consistent pattern of thought to reveal when caught. They may intrude but there is little to gain from questioning them about it afterwards as they don't have anything to respond with. 
They may also often act weak or ignorant which they unlike men are not penalised for being.

Having no right to dominate women or immoral normies who live with you, the living space and possessions would gradually fall into their hands, them stopping only at the bare minimum you need to exist as laws and norms are not holding them back. Complete men can basically not live with persons who intrude on your immaterial possessions such as feelings, space and dignity, nor can they work with those who act the same; they can only healthily interact with other men of complete minds, a pleasure bereft of those with low calorie brains and small minds. 



Female alpha / beta behaviour may appear to be primitive or childish. It may, to the non-manipulative person, simply seem to be non-ideal.
Lets have a some examples:

Ex.1: A woman asks her girlfriends if she should go out with someone. She is a beta female and would be penalised if she got together with someone and the alpha female did not like it. The alpha female is among her girlfriends.

Ex.2: An alpha female who is a boss at a workplace in the public sector tells her beta female employee to not provide a form for a male customer as he does not have a drivers license. Later, at the interaction he shows her his drivers license but she acts as if she doesn't understand and signals to him to leave without saying why. She does this as to not enrage her alpha female and draw a penalty to herself with would be done if she served the man. If she would ask the alpha female what to do, she would potentially become enraged, tell her to not provide the form as she cannot change her mind, and penalise the woman for not just doing what she is told and ask a question back.

Ex.3: An alpha female tells someone, a man or a woman to do something. The told does something else which appears to yield a better result. The alpha female ruins their result and tells them to do it her way, thus signalling that disobedience, even to evidently bad advice will be punished. The person concedes and uses the conventional way, not exploring what appears to be a better way due to a threat.

Ex.4: A beta female follow the order of an alpha female but fails to accomplish the result. The alpha female steals something equivalent to the result from a nearby but previously unrelated man and gives it to her. The man does not have the legal standing to steal it back as he is along and a group of women would be against him if he tried. The justice system is misandric as is known.

Ex.5: A man has not followed the advice of an alpha female. She nags him and slanders him until he changes his mind. He must not only follow her advice but submit and compensate every second of apparent disrespect as she sadistically penalises all other behaviour.

Ex.6: A beta female falls for a mental cel. Her alpha female breaks them up and penalises both of them for getting together as the intelligence and morals of the mental cel is a threat to her authority. She is repulsed by smart moral men too.

Ex.7: Alpha females team up to unjustly hurt a group of men, without which they cannot remove the past rivalry between their groups.



Most of this behaviour is instinctual but some intelligence is needed to stay on top and not be usurped. A dark triad personality is a necessity. There are men who are disadvantaged by alpha females who hate them instinctually because of their intelligence and morals which are threats to their authority. They can become mental cels because of this. Most women look around, see what is normal and beneficial to appear to like and think and just becomes that without thinking about disembodied morality. They also find a gang to follow or become an alpha female in. A gang of females are more powerful than a man even if the law itself is on his side. 

Women are often reflexive in their thinking, giving set responses for set conditions. They may become violent if introduced to unrehearsed situations.
They can treat phrases as spells, not caring for their literal meaning but only what they make people do. If someone say ""Why don't you do that?"" without specifying what and standing provocingly close to you from behind, it may be more likely to make you do what she is trying to make you do than if she has just told you to do it; it is in addition difficult to make a statement of your own against an act like that. They may not recognise this behaviour as immoral as they may only categorise something to do or think as right or wrong depending on negative consequences for herself. This explains protesters who protest for inconsistent absurdity but would be penalised if they had the correct red-pilled opinion. The ruling powers will have such people on their side as long as they penalise them for appearing to have different thoughts.
It may only be stopped by creating your own state and penalising them for not being of your own preferred orthodoxy. They crave an approximate yet orthodox path to follow and don't want true freedom of opinion for themselves as it makes them feel insecure and lonely. They may then be violent or compete for a new alpha status in such a situation as they can only dominate or be dominated.

Women and especially women who are after power and positions of true authority in particular have a great inner misandric sadism even if it is hidden or in slumber as mere potential. Misandric sadism knows no bounds, especially when fuelled in a group of ecstatic misandric women like on Oprah. They can be ecstatic and spasm out on the floor like in a charismatic afro-american Church. It is as if the air is filled with hormones of misandry and ecstasy. Such is the misandric nature of women.
Women don't have true altruistic empathy for men; if they had, they would perhaps have pity fucked you or something of the sort.



Part 3: Individual selective females

Females are more individual selective than males. Males have a sense of truth and are more prone to self sacrifice by giving their live for the group. It is ironic that the group which is more individual selective more often gangs up to mercilessly genocide or hinder the group selective group. It is because of egoism, lack of empathy, lack of mercy and only looking to your own good, not that of the group, nation, humanity or world.

Females favour individual selection when selecting mates. Women favour violence, fear and the dark triad of personality besides good physique and health which are universally healthy. It is called archaic selection as contemporary success is often derived from money and inherited status rather than the genes which were adaptable during the stone age. If the group got destroyed in war by a more group selective group, women would just have sex with the males of the victorious people akin to how lionesses mate with the male lion as soon as he has killed her kids and baby daddy. It lies thus in the male interest to increase group selection while female instincts which favour individual selective traits remain. This can be done by normalising a culture of arranged marriage or to execute males who practice abundantly individual selective behaviour. Said executees may have stolen or killed those better than them within the group.

It is common for a country to have a small nepotistic ruling class with individual selective traits such as psychopathy while also having a large under class with individual selective traits. They have low IQ and are unsuccessful regarding nepotism. The middle class is the only group which is a net contributor. They lose money through taxes and extracted surplus value. It is the only class that is policed by the police as the 2 classes with individual selective persons are above and below the law respectively. The person or class of group selective traits concerns itself with net production, not in themselves getting the sum total of the fruits of their labour.
The person or group of individual selective values concerns itself with acquiring pieces of the cake, not increasing its size or the ethics of doing so.
The former focuses on the moral victory in picking up more trash than left in nature while the latter focuses on their hierarchical victory in doing the opposite and having the moral expend calories to amend their own wrongdoings.

Whenever you wonder why someone does something un-clever or immoral, just ask if that is what evolution favours. 
It often favours such traits, particularly when you consider who benefits from the archaic selection of women.
The issue of why humans are moral but not moral all the way through, or simply selectively moral, can, to the person who wonders why evolution has favoured group selective traits like self sacrifice, be answered with how evolution by natural selection creates a balance between group selective traits and individual selective traits.

It is more favourable to be individual selective within an individual selective group than the alternative at to not be ostracised and sentenced to death due to the immorality of others. The burden of being a nice guy among parasites attests to this. It is more favourable to be group selective in a group selective group than in an individual selective group as to avoid capital punishment in the former and having immoralities committed against you in the latter due to crab mentality and unmotivated sadism.

An individual selective incel would be opportunistic and try to scam himself to reproduction. A group selective incel would remove himself from the gene pool.
Going ER against blood enemies could be a group selective trait if incels are your in group. 
Many great monks and scientists have become volcels as to help their group through writings or inventions instead of just increasing the next batch of kids by a negligible sum. They would have to be group selective to make such a decision. 
Their individual selective counterpart would just have reproduced while being parasites on their surroundings.

Women are individually selective by how they act, affect society and select mates. That corresponds with the inversion of modern conventional morals as group selective traits correlate with it and are the polar opposite, regarding morals and evolutionary strategy to the traits that as aforementioned are net derived from females.
Civilisations can be destroyed due to being over run by barbarians but the net pattern across history is that more group selective civilisations expands and dominates though economic, military, cultural and spiritual imperialism. Women and female sexual selection undermines racial survival, civilisation and its positive effects on nature in contrast with the an-prim handling of nature which is shorter term and not governed by laws.
While a gender which limits reproduction and acts more akin to conventionally immoral individual selective traits as well as favouring them through sexual selection can seem like a problem in its own, it also appears to hinder peoples as a whole in the great grind of human peoples that occur during history. 



Part 4: On being too smart or stupid for women.

The most common problem is being too smart. Normal negroes can have plenty of sex and father many children. If a white person would be less intelligent than what is normal for Negroes, he must've had some great disability like downs syndrome. Only being too smart is a problem normally. One may be too dumb if it is relative to the other males in the circle and is ostracised for it. It is then not the intelligence level itself that is the problem but that the male is branded as weird, outcast and inferior in the mind of the woman. She would be less able to conform with her friends if her man was an outlier in any way including one that would make the alpha female jealous.

Let me tell you why high IQ is a problem. When women seek out men, high IQ (>115) and low IQ (<50) may be a turnoff. Humanity had an average IQ of around 70 during most of the stone age. Women are adapted for the type of man who would be successful, thrive and blend in in that ecology. Big brained boyos can adapt and blend in better than those who don't understand. Women are increasingly repulsed by those with high IQ because that is the bigger problem, the one with higher likelihood to appear and that women as a whole show disdain for the most. This is only important when a woman seeks out a male. Turbochad can get away with Mensa level IQ and normal Chad doesn't show his IQ when he is with women alone.

There is a quote that says that women want a man that's smart enough to be useful but dumb enough to be used. A woman will find it hard to manipulate a man with a big mind. She wants a man who is not and cannot become aware of how bad she is. There is a crab mentality amongst normies and women, the latter foremost.
It means that they want to hurt, kill and slander those who are or have it better than themselves. This means that smart males are often ganged up on in school, made outcasts and thus yeeted off the list of potential partners. Being friendless and outside of primal high energy gangs is abundantly common the smarter and more moral a man is, the former having greater significance. This repulses women too.

A woman is never alone; she is with her gang of females with a leader who they outsource their thinking and opinion making to as I have written about above. Said leader must be a bit smart to keep her followers. Anyone who knows something she doesn't is a threat to her; anyone who is more intelligent and analytical than her is an even greater threat. A man who is more intelligent than her and has integrity to tell the truth cannot be allowed close to her subjects. She penalises that type of men for approaching, making her subjects dislike him, making him know it and paring her subjects up with men of lesser intelligence, men she can control or at least understand and predict.
This type of woman typically also has a great deal of misandry and crab mentality.

A man of wisdom and big brain power can only meet a women when she approaches him alone which only happen if he as if he has not shown his intellects or is a Turbochad which it's hard to become in a first world country as you need to kill men openly, humiliate them, strike fear into those who aren't abundantly submissive.
They may kill one of you and get away with it if the Chad police doesn't know they have made a big deal about it, provided evidence and use it to be more feared and respected than said police officers. Fear is the only kind of respect the incomplete human mind can express; low IQ humans are like mid tier mammals in this sense; even the great apes need to prove their leadership skills and morals to become leader, not just subjugate any rival like a male cat.

IQ level, especially if too high or along with neuroticism and non-literal autism can most especially make an incel. Women judge you by how you look and reject you immediately in their mind if you are too smart or dumb. That which they lack in their brains as aforementioned must be as if it would have made them more sensible, grateful and merciful had they had it, which they do not. It¨s ironic how bad taste in men women have.

I assume that being too low IQ can embarass yourself figuring out the simplest stuff and need people to repeat themselves to understand. My condolences go not only to high IQ males or males as a whole but I wish it to go to the whole world, lest it gain what it deserve in spite of the more likely reality. 



Part 5: Distribution of females part 1: Male mate-guarding

Different species have different behaviour. There is only one known species of bird in which female infidelity has not been documented. It is common for male birds to follow the females around to make sure nobody else has sex with her. Mallards are a symbol of love and the male protects its female but if the male would get killed by another male, the female would start taking his sperm instead. Males guard and patrol females like cattle and are in turn treated as non-living entities that do good or harm but who are not entitled to altruistic help.

Males patrol females among felines and primates. In both these types of animal, the male must follow the female around wherever she may walk and fight off any other male that wants to have sex with her. Only rarely would the male penalise the female for walking too much. Males have evolves super female patrolling capabilities due to natural selection.

The male lynx which only weighs about 25 kg can have territories as large as 450 square kilometres, larger than several small countries, an area which could provide food for multitudes of males, just to be able to have sex with the females in the territory. The males walks through and around his territory every day and fight other males but the females can cross the territorial lines in search of a superior male as they like.

A reason for why mating season is only a fraction of the year may be because of how many calories it consumes for walking. The female, regardless of feline or primate would like a flesh-light get shagged by the new male as soon as he won a fight against the old one unless he was an ugly opportunistic incel. She would invite Chads to kill the incel and compete for her vagina if an incel had the guts, a choice which would likely lead to its death but also be its best chance of passing on its genes. Females even mate with the new males when he has just killed her only descendants earlier that day.

Most male lions live between the family territories on a mere fraction of the surface the more successful Chad lions guard as their own. They get enough food; they just don't get the females as they are incels and none of them controls a large surface area, area which does not only has a fixed density of prey but a fixed density of females. Females walk between the territories of the alphas but they don't stay at the borders where the adaptively inferior incel lions live.

Males are evolved to be violent and control large territories, especially during the mating season if they are Chads and to be submissive and opportunistic if incel.
Females are evolved to be like soul-less flesh-lights unless an incel or superior specimen is nearby at which point she instigated duels to the death between the males.
They want to always be in the proximity of a manipulative alpha male to keep this ability; even incels are stronger than females among the patriarchal species.
Mammals and birds which are the most intelligent animals can be said to be patriarchal as the males are larger than the females in contrast with most of the animal kingdom.

Human females exhibit above described behaviour. There are various posts about women orbiting and pursuing their former rapists and posts about feeling defiled when they found out that the man they had sex with was not up to par with her other options. Females don't care about consent very much; they care about Chadliness and the feelings they get when their instincts detect competitive genes. Female selection of mates is archaic; it would be smarter to marry an average looking millionaire young and have lots of well fed children which is what women do in un-automated societies as to avoid physical labour even if they often cheat when an imposing elite specimen is found. Their instincts tell them to, beside going for healthy physiques which is a positive trait, go for men of violence, below average IQ, being threatening, immoral, without integrity and of the dark triad.

It is posted on r/femaledatingadvice that they should go to wrestling matches and sport games with different teams with their mates and instigate fighting over her among the males to get the strongest most adaptive sexy one. Females do this in nature too. Millions of bucks headbutt each other to death each year even if females could settle down with one male and not be alluring to other males. Females reject that way of lives among ungulates and among primates, including humans.

A female would signal to the Chad immoral police officers if you even tried to act confident around her, as if that would lure her to your below average looks.
They can also signal to other Chads to beat you down, preferably to death on their part as they would be alleviated of a genetic bio hazard without spending time in jail.
Females don't mind going to frat houses where raping and roofing is known to be common common as long as the men are Chad enough. The fact that they rape, get away with it and get returning guests is in itself a signalling of Chad-dom, that they can do and without inhibition do this. There might be apparent exceptions but the bulk of female behaviour regarding mate selection, especially of the r-selected sort, leads to this model of explanation. Humans are r-selected and individual selective at the core which is apparent by that the norms and morals which must be imposed by authority are k-selective and collective selective.

Females of fertile age are repulsed by men of below average visual and genetic standard; you are to them what cucking and castration would be to you if to you had the smv and lack of accountability of a female. Females of younger and older ages can be nice but a more attractive charismatic male specimen will appear better in every way all other things being equal. Males are evolved to patrol, protect and not attack; incels are evolved to remove themselves from the gene pool for its better sake. 



Part 6: Distribution of females part 2: The futility of being a low status male

The 80/20 rule states which men women pursue. If the 80/20 rule is true, a man in the bottom 80% has a 1/4 chance of having a gf. If the 80/20 rule is true within the 80% of men which it probably is, a man in the bottom 64% has a 1/16 chance of having a gf. Consequently, the men in the bottom 51.2 % must share 0.25^3 of the women and have only a 1/64 chance of having a girlfriend. If the 80/20 rule is true is true for the top 20% of men, the top 4% of men can have 16 gf:s each on average. The average man has such a low chance of having a woman pursuing him while the top men, the Chads according to this mathemathical model have so many women pursuing them. The top 20% of men alone have 4 women pursuing each of them on average. If you are in the bottom 20% of men, only 0.00000046256% of women are pursuing you according to this formula.
The graph I posted in my original thread about this  reveal that the sum of women who must be shared is negligible for the bottom 3/4 of men. The space to the right of a point on the graph represent a share of men while the space above that point represent their share of women. The point which is left of 80% of the X axis representing 80% of males is only below 20% of the Y axis representing 20% of females.

Tinder says that only 15% of its male users have met anyone irl through the app at all. This includes homosexuals who use tinder instead of Grinder and men who were rejected before they could have sex. This must mean that men who are 9/10 must compete for the lowest of the low of tinder using females.

Women are a zero-sum-game.
If you by ascending, take a woman, you are taking a woman from someone else who otherwise would have gotten her. Women like to go to places where males compete over them. Regardless of how much effort you put into getting women or increase your smv, the total number of women stays the same; the only thing that has increased is the effort spent on getting one. Women behave badly because of all the effort spent getting them; it increases their ego and fuels their narcisism. This allegory would fit best in a monogamous or mildly polygamous society. It means much more for you to have sex than for Chad who might spend a night watching cartoons instead of sending eggplant emojis to his loyal tinder matches. The statement remains true though. Regardless of how much effort you or anyone else spend on getting women, the only thing increasing is the effort spent on them; the women stay the same number and get worse if anything.
It appears, due to that which is described in this sixth segment, to be so pointless and futile to pursue women above other activities regardless of how fulfilling it would be to have a healing relationship with a good nawalt woman and have your penis grasped by a hand smaller than your own.



Part 7: Jews and their Jewry

While degeneracy occurs naturally, it can be milked out of people, the Jews appear to be milkers. 
I have hypothesised that group selective males dislike ped*philic actions as the older gains little while the younger loses much. They are not ped*philes and would not commit such acts. It would make sense that men with individual selective traits like to commit ped*philic actions, at least to females of their out group. They gain little themselves but the other person and its tribe loses much in dignity. A person who tortures recreationally or considers an enemy tribe to be lawful prey while hunting would view it as an easily acquired delicacy among all the ways to humiliate your enemy. It is said that Jews may have sex with a goy child as young as 3 according to their holy texts while other rules apply to Jews. It is also said that they used to drink blood of children through straws during the middle ages which would be an archetypal individual or at least tribal selective trait. Some people are naive and think that no humans lack complex empathy despite the evidence and think that no such custom could have been practised by humans but they would be wrong as shown by evidence. Complex empathy is among the later acquired parts of the human mind and is not present among all types of humans.

The island of Jeffrey Epstein and his female Mossad agent co-worker was one of several in which the Jew heavy elite bribed and gained blackmail material of those who are placed in power. Ped*philic actions were committed there, both by Bill and Hillary Clinton. The activity may not only be a bribe and a source of blackmail but also a way to screen out people who due to ethnic alliances or individual selective traits would not mind having sex with a blonde 9 year old. Those who passed would lack the philia / comradery that The ancient Greek philosophers thought were necessary to maintain a democratic state. Empires such as the British or Russian have used peoples against each other in order to maintain control. Food was grown in walled in gardens in British India while the masses starved on the street outside. Monotheistic minorities like Sikhs and Muslims were privileged above the Hindu masses in India at that time. Those who are placed in positions of authority such as presidents of countries lack this philia with the populace which is why they don't mind the replacement of peoples. The following segment which is taken from one of my earlier posts describes what I think is the plan.

Parliament politician isn't nearly the top.
There are organisations such as the Freemasons, the Jews, the security agencies, secret organisations, -
-unknown organisations and organisations with secret properties in which the true power lies.
There is an elite within these organisations with a plan. This is what they plan to do:
In the west, they will forcefully immigrate and ship in middle easterners with 85 IQ.
Then they will forcefully immigrate and ship in Africans with 70 IQ
Then they will kill off them and establish the population they want which will have an average IQ around 80.
In China, they will gather women in cities, leaving the countryside increasingly barren of women.
This will make it easy to kill or sterilise all women and keep the next generation from knowing how to grow food.
Mass starvation is their plan for India and China.
They will try to overpopulate and then starve India, completely destroying its wilderness, food storage and respectable peoples.
They could help the illiterates against the literates when the big struggle for food arrives.
Their plans for Africa is similar for that of India. They use Africa as a demographic bomb with which they can destroy the European first world countries.
The global human population will plummet.
Nanobots will be used to kill opposition people individually.
They, a jew-heavy elite will create a state for themselves which the rest of the population will serve under anarcho-primitivistic conditions and medial and religious control.
New innovations will rarely be made. The lack of reproduction among intelligent moral creative high inhib men has been planned and no more such men will be born.
All populations except the elite will be mixed and without language or history; they will only have the media as guide for who they are.
The coming masses will have an average IQ of 80 which means that they can't organise on their own, being gradually bred to never stand out or revolt.
It will be like a combination of 1984, Brave new world, the stone age and the Bible/Talmud.
Technology will gradually decline. There will only be one space age in human history and it will soon come to an end.

The women and normies are their secret police for meat-space. They act predictably and are placed in positions that they wouldn't reach through meritocracy alone.
Women make up around half of parliament level politicians in many western countries. They may or may not know what they are doing but the privilege their designated positions grant them along with their innate individual selective traits that keeps them chained to their own egoistic good and not in comradery with the masses means that they, with some exceptions, will stay there as long as they can.
It is truly immoral to, as aforementioned, place individual selective people in positions of authority over populations that could do much better on their own.
That brings me to the next segment; people should be left to the social order they themselves create.



Part 8: The simple solution

The best of worlds would not have any humans. It would have completely different physical, logical, abstract and moral laws. We would not be able to comprehend it as our brains are only evolved for this world. We can't even fully grasp that there is something out of nothing, that the world has always existed or any third explanation for why the world exists. Any sentient creator of the rest must also be a part of the world. The world would be better without humans.

People should be left to the social order they themselves create. People should be segregated into groups with their own level of group selectiveness. That is the base line for my simple solution. An idiot admires complexity while a genius admires simplicity.
The better alternative is that humanity goes extinct, the worst people first as to not just throw the wheel of development back a few steps with the departure of the best.

The best human society would be a cast society in which everyone fits into its surrounding like a piece of a puzzle. This doesn't mean that resistance is never met nor mistakes made, just that its not too abundant. The different castes would have genetically predestined traits and treated how they should be treated since birth.
It would not be like in Brave New World as people would have freedom to follow their inclinations; they would have genetically predestined inclinations to be satisfied and do that which is best. This is an unattainable utopia and humanity should become extinct; the earth should be thrown out of orbit and into the sun."

UNCIRUMSIZED MEN LAST LONGER



Circumcised men tend to penetrate much more vigorously, in the jackhammer style that is so familiar from our cultural depiction of intercourse. This style of penetration comes from a desperate search for more stimulation and the need to concentrate sensations on the tip of the penis.

The thing about having sex with an uncircumcised guy is you don’t get dry. There’s not as much friction involved, so you can go on for a lot longer. I absolutely prefer uncircumcised. Only thing is, guys with foreskins really don’t like having a condom on, because it’s more suffocating. And that can be a problem.

"Article about suicide in people with arthritis, and how it makes women use more violent suicide methods",Blackpill,Deleted member 19,"Jun 12, 2020",12000,53,"I've often seen citations that women attempt suicide more but succeed less, and this being put down to women using less violent methods.

Before their suicide, 50% of the female RA patients (vs 11% of the male RA patients) had experienced at least one suicide attempt. The method of suicide was violent in 90% of the RA females.

academic.oup.com





Now this particular passage says that in 90% of the female suicides were violent in women with RA. Why is this interesting?

To me this would suggest that in reality, womens low suicide success rate in normal cases is due to the fact that they don't want to die. As seen here, when women have an actual reason to die, like severe arthritis pain, they don't shy away from using more violent methods. Thus this would suggest that in most female suicide attempts, the reason for using less violent is not because of womens inherent lack of violent nature, but because they simply don't actually want to die. Meanwhile women who do actually want to die will use the same violent methods that men who want to die do.

While it shouldn't be too shocking, I think it's interesting to see an actual study that would corroborate the idea that the high attempt low success rate is due to women straight up just not actually wanting to kill themselves."
"Women have a rejection-mindset, they get pickier as their options increase (ie online dating) and are less likely to be satisfied with their choices",Blackpill,Gymcelled,"Mar 26, 2021",12000,66,"Nothing earth shattering, more confirmations of what we already knew: women are extremely picky, only become pickier with more choice, are less satisfied with their picks than men, etc. It's sort of brutal and amusing how the authors straight say women have a REJECTION-MINDSET.

 This study really shows how online dating and social media have completely obliterated the dating market by making women's inherent pickiness much worse than it already was.

 BUT REMEMBER, PEOPLE TELL MEN THAT THEY ARE THE ONES WHO NEED TO LOWER THEIR STANDARDS
CLOWN FUCKING WORLD  @ThoughtfulCel

 Here are some direct quotes from the study itself, in the style of the inkwel wiki @Blackpincel

The dating landscape has changed drastically over the past decade, with more and more people looking for a partner online People have never been able to select partners among such an enormous pool of options. [...] The rise of online dating coincided with an increase in the amount of singles in society

People become increasingly likely to reject potential partners to the extent that they are presented with more options

Overall, the adverse effects of choice abundance in dating thus seem to apply particularly to women—the gender that is already much less likely to accept potential partners to begin with, possibly consistent with evolutionary pressures (Buss & Schmitt, 1993).

In all studies, women became increasingly likely to reject potential partners, while for men this effect was either weaker (Study 1), similar (Study 2), or not significant (Study 3).

[...] across all three studies, there was a negative relationship between overall rejection behavior and satisfaction with the partner options participants accepted [...] people who were more rejecting were more likely to be less satisfied with the smaller number of partner options they did accept compared to people who were overall more accepting.

Because women typically reject more, they might also cumulate rejections more quickly and thus more easily adopt a rejection mind-set.

[...] when a choice set increases, people end up being less satisfied with their ultimate partner choice and more prone to reverse their decision [...] when asked to pick the best partner, access to more partner profiles resulted in more searching, more time spent on evaluating bad choice options, and a lower likelihood of selecting the option with the best personal fit

[...] the stream of partner profiles can set in motion an overall feeling of dissatisfaction and pessimism about finding a mate, which leads users to gradually “close off” from mating opportunities. Our findings might therefore explain why people are increasingly dissatisfied and frustrated by modern dating.

[...]across all studies, acceptance rate decreased over the course of online dating.

The dating landscape has changed drastically over the past decade, with more and more people looking for a partner online (Hobbs, Owen, & Gerber, 2017). People have never been able to select partners among such an enormous pool of options. As an example, the 10 million active daily users of the popular online dating application Tinder are on average presented with 140 partner options a day (Smith, 2018). While one may expect this drastic increase in mating opportunities to result in an increasing number of romantic relationships, the opposite has occurred: The rise of online dating coincided with an increase in the amount of singles in society (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek, 2019; Copen, Daniels, Vespa, & Mosher, 2012; DePaulo, 2017). What could explain this paradox in modern dating?

Click to expand...





The abundance of choice in online dating is one of the key factors which explains its success (Lenton & Stewart, 2008). People like having many options to choose from, and the likelihood of finding an option that matches someone’s individual preference should logically increase with more choice (Lancaster, 1990; Patall, Cooper, & Robinson, 2008). However, having extensive choice can have various adverse effects, such as paralysis (i.e., not making any decision at all) and decreased satisfaction (Iyengar & Lepper, 2000; Scheibehenne, Greifeneder, & Todd, 2010; Schwartz, 2004). In fact, it seems that people generally experience less benefits when they have more choice. This observation is reminiscent of the basic economic principle of diminishing returns (Brue, 1993; Shephard & Färe, 1974), in which each unit that is sequentially added to the production process results in less profits.

Click to expand...





There is some indirect evidence that having more choice in the domain of dating also has negative consequences. For example, when asked to pick the best partner, access to more partner profiles resulted in more searching, more time spent on evaluating bad choice options, and a lower likelihood of selecting the option with the best personal fit (Wu & Chiou, 2009). Likewise, when a choice set increases, people end up being less satisfied with their ultimate partner choice and more prone to reverse their decision (D’Angelo & Toma, 2017). The adverse effects of choice overload are also mentioned in articles in popular media mentioning phenomena such as “Tinder fatigue” (Beck, 2016) or “dating burnout” (Blair, 2017).

Spoiler: What the 3 studies were about



We tested the existence of a rejection mind-set in online dating across three studies. In Study 1, we presented people with pictures of hypothetical partners, to test if and when people’s general choice behavior would change. In Study 2, we presented people with pictures of partners that were actually available and tested the gradual development of their choice behaviors as well as their success rate in terms of mutual interest (i.e., matches). In Study 3, we explored potential underlying psychological mechanisms. Specifically, and in line with choice overload literature, we explored whether the rejection mind-set may be due to people experiencing lower choice satisfaction and less success over the course of online dating. As an additional goal, we explored the potential moderating role of gender. In all studies, we focused on participants between 18 and 30 years old—a group that makes up 79% of all users of online dating applications (Smith, 2018).

Ethnic male celibacy >30% in 2018,Blackpill,RageAgainstTDL,"May 6, 2018",31000,126,"From the NORC GSS survey:






True ethnic men at >30% celibacy in 2018 and still skyrocketing.

Ethnic = Chinese, Indian, etc.

Blacks and whites have nothing to complain about."
"My response to the: ""we only expose the crazy stuff incels do, we're not making fun of virgins""-argument.",Hypocrisy,DonezoTheClown,"Dec 6, 2020",14000,49,"This is the argument I see every IT-user use to justify their obsession and bullying of incels. I differentiate between incels and virgins only because braindead IT-lurkers would never understand otherwise, incel means involuntary celibate and not what some retarded IT-foid wants to change it to.

Why I'm arguing against this idea of theirs?
It's common knowledge that if you're spending your days rotting on IT you're probably just as pathetic as us, would someone with a great life and a bunch of kids or alot of friends to hang out with really be spending their time on some forum shitting on other people? No, you know it, we know it. These people love their own personality so much they feel they should lecture us on ours constantly, if only we were more like them because they are such great people. Showing them arguments they can't refute why their personality is dogshit will either make them realize they're bad people and stop doing it or realize they're hypocritical hateful people which destroys their whole identity of being ""the good guys"".

Even if you only pointed out the bad stuff (which is a lie), you're still only focussing on one very small mostly depressed close to suicide group of people.
Imagine if a cop was only arresting black people and has been doing so for weeks, months, some of you wackos even years, never arrested or ticketed a white person in all that time just 100% black people. White people could even do worse crimes than black people and the cop would ignore it but keep fucking with all the black people doing petty crimes. Would you think that's racist of this cop? Ofcourse you would, you're progressive leftie. But aren't you doing the same to incels? I look at your post histories, it's IT, it's neckbeardthings, it's niceguys, maybe some dyke-stuff or feminist-stuff in there. None of you have ever watched a woman or a Chad or a muslim or an SJW do anything wrong, you only care when incels or niceguys do something bad. The comparison is actually too charitable because there is no widespread depression or high suiciderate among blacks while there is for incels, but I know how much you soys care about your minorities.
Here are some examples of some of you who are guilty of this:
/u/Liz_is_a_lemon u/SykoSarah u/the_moonshine u/Princess_kitty14 u/Zoomie1977 u/LadyFausta

Saying ""this is why you're an incel"" when we say shit you don't like is the same as ""this is why you're a virgin"". You use our inceldom against us, you look down on us and there must be something wrong with us, why else would bad thing = reason why you're not getting laid? But the same people who think this will also tell us ""there isn't anything wrong with being a virgin and they would never look down on us for that reason soysoysoy"". Make up your mind IT it can't be both. 
I wanna add that I truely hope that the foids of IT have the IQ high enough to understand that them spreading their legs isn't proof that their personality is good, it's not, in fact most of your personalities are dogshit and men would never hang out with you if they weren't trying to get laid. The fact you sit on IT makes you even worse than the average foid. You have no reason to look down on anyone.

This is an assumption but I think it's a good one so I'll throw it in there anyways: You don't tell anyone about your secret hobby of shitting on suicidal, mentally ill people who have a rough life, if you're such a good person why wouldn't you tell your family and your friends and your colleagues about your favorite hobby? Again it's an assumption, I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt that you aren't so retarded that you would openly talk about your vile hobby with anyone, if you do then you're a complete psychobitch but you aren't guilty of this one.

I think it's safe to say reddit has a leftwing bias, your subreddit wouldn't exist if you did the same to transgenders, fat people, homeless people, suicidal people, blacks, gays and dykes even if you used the mental gymnastics argument of the title. Reddit is guilty as well and basically every reddit-cuck who justifies your shitty subreddit even if they don't partake in it. Don't use reddit as the judge of what is right and wrong.

Some normies and kids sympathize with schoolshooters if they realize they were bullied by people their entire lives. Heck that whole Joker movie was based on it and normies loved it. I can see why you don't. Sure you could argue that ""the joker wasn't the good guy in that movie"" but the white guys who bulled him on the train definitely weren't nor was the guy who made fun of him on live TV. So even the world hates you, they might not know about you or fall for your lies but they do hate who you are deep down inside, not just us.

Anyways, hope that helps you guys sleep at night."

Accordingly, at week 17, an increase in maternal testosterone levels from the 25th to the 75th percentile was associated with a decrease in birth weight by 160 g (95% confidence interval (CI); 29-290 g), while at week 33 that estimate was 115 g (95% CI; 21-207 g).""

ULTIMATE TEENLOVEPILL: PROOF THAT TEEN LOVE IS IMPORTANT (EVERYONE GTFIH),Blackpill,Edmund_Kemper,"Oct 18, 2020",40000,168,"Many people who are bluepilled say that teen love doesn't matter and that missing out on it doesn't do any harm. Here's proof that missing out on teen love is harmful.

In a pivotal study about involuntary celibacy from 2001, they talked to three involuntarily celibate groups of people: Involuntary virgins (those who never had sex and still are sexually inexperienced), singles (those who had sexual experience in the past but no longer are able to, and a good amount of these people resorted to hookers or even sexual surrogates), and partnered celibates (those who are married or in a relationship but their partner won't have sex). 91% of the virgins said they never dated as teenagers, compared to 52% of singles. Here's an important quote:

""In summary, while most of our sample had discussed sex with friends and experimented with masturbation as teens, most of the virgins and singles did not date. Singles were similar to partnered persons in terms of first sexual experiences, while the majority of virgins reported first sexual experiences that did not include another person. As the data illustrates, virgins and singles may have missed important transitions, and as they got older, their trajecto- ries began to differ from those of their age peers. As Thorton (1990) noted, patterns of sexuality in young adult- hood are significantly related to dating, steady dating, and sexual experience in adolescence. It is rare for a teenager to initiate sexual activity outside of a dating relationship. Thus, persons reaching young adulthood without dating may have missed an important opportunity for sexual experience. While virginity and lack of experience are fair- ly common in teenagers and young adults (Sprecher & Regan, 1996), by the time many of our respondents reached their mid-twenties they reported feeling left behind by age peers. We suspect that this is especially true for gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth. In fact, all eight of the nonheterosexual respondents in our sample were either virgins or singles. As previous researchers have shown, a major reason for becoming off time in making sexual tran- sitions is the process of coming out to oneself and others (Gonsiorek & Rudolph, 1991). Even for the heterosexuals in our study, however, it appears that lack of dating and sexual experimentation in the teen years may be precursors to problems in adult sexual relationships (Thorton, 1990).""

Another quote I found from another study (which has more to do with juvenile sex offenders and autism):

""The foundation for a healthy sexuality in adulthood lies in childhood and adolescence, with the discovery of one’s own sexuality oftentimes going in phases (De Graaf et al.2009). A large population study in the Netherlands amongst 7841 boys and girls aged 12–25 has shown that half of all 15-year-old adolescents have been intimate with a partner (e.g., touching each other’s genitalia). At age 16, half of all youths have experience with mutual masturba- tion and at age 17, half of all youths have experienced sexual intercourse and/or oral sex (De Graaf et al. 2015). Eventually, relationships and sexual intimacy become more serious; relationships last longer and are more exclusive, eventually leading to the ‘adult’ model of a committed relationship (Furman and Shaffer 2003).""

Here's another study:

“One study showed that adult virgins have higher odds of being overweight and of being perceived as physically unattractive. Four additional studies reported that adult virgins have greater probabilities of never having been in a romantic relationship. Moreover, in a qualitative study conducted among 82 involuntary celibate adults aged 18 to 64 years, Donnelly and colleagues found that nearly all adult virgins never dated anyone, including in adolescence. Thus, findings converge to support the importance of romantic and sexual experiences during adolescence for ongoing romantic and sexual development in adulthood. Additionally, this study revealed that these adult virgins perceived themselves as being very shy and unable to establish social contacts, and reported body image issues, such as being overweight and perceiving their physical appearance to be an obstacle to their sexuality.”

Brave New World by Aldous Huxley is often seen as the counterpart of 1984, which together with Fahrenheit 451, form the three most beloved and well-known dystopian sci-fi novels of the early 20th century. But while 1984 paints a picture of a dictatorship where people are ruled by pain and fear, which has almost become a cliché at this point, Brave New World uses a concept that feels much more original and 'fresh' (even though it's from the 1930s) for the genre, which is a world where the government controls people through pleasure.

The world of Brave New World is one which is controlled by a world government, where Christianity and all other religions are replaced with the worship of Henry Ford and science, where everyone speaks one global language, where parenthood and families no longer exist because babies are created by the government and where sex and drugs form the centers of people's lives.
Monogamy is looked down upon and people are encouraged to have sex with as many people as possible and not stay with one partner for more than a few weeks. The view of sex which people in this world have and the way it reflects the modern west's Tinder or hook-up culture which is now popular in the west while also the way the main characters struggle with the desire for a monogamous relationship is the reason why I believe most incels will find this book highly relatable. In the foreword of a 1964 release of the book, Huxley wrote that the sexual aspect of Brave New World's society was partly inspired by the high divorce rates of the cities in the US.




Nor does the sexual promiscuity of Brave New World seem so very distant. There are already American cities in which the number of divorces is equal to the number of marriages. In a few years, no doubt, marriage licences will be sold like dog licences, good for a period of twelve months, with no law against changing dogs or keeping more than one animal at a time. As political and economic freedom diminishes, sexual freedom tends compensatingly to increase.

The book has two main characters; Bernard Marx, who is the main character of what you can consider the first part of the book and John Savage, the main character of the second part of the book. Which one of the two you will most relate to may depend on your outlook on modern society.

Bernard Marx is of very small stature, which is an important aspect of his character because the world in which the book is set in contains a caste system where the highest Alpha caste members are tall and physically strong while the members of the lowest castes are described as dwarves. Marx, even though he is of the highest caste, the Alpha-Plus, physically resembles people of the much lower castes which he is often ridiculed for by his fellow Alphas. Marx, because of his manletdom and his anti-social tendencies, is essentially an incel, which is quite unusual seeing as the society he lives in encourages people to have as many sexual partners as possible. The character of Lenina, who is one of the two important female characters of the book, for example, nearly rejects his offer to visit the US together because of what she perceives as his abnormal behaviour. The segment in which Lenina ponders with her female friend over what to do seems like it could be a regular, real-life conversation today between women, as the various male partners they have had are compared with each other as if they were shopping through a clothing store to look for the perfect piece. Not very different from how people nowadays 'date around' to find their 'soulmate'.
Marx realizes something is wrong with the society he lives in but his hatred for it, in the end, comes down to not being able to participate it in the way others can. He despises the hyper-sexual nature of society and considers it degenerate, yet, at the same time, he also wants to engage in lots of sex and connect with people, just like everyone else does. I think this mindset reflects that of a lot of this site's members. On the one hand, most of us romanticize the west from before the sexual revolution, when lifelong marriages were still possible and desire lifelong companionship like that for ourselves. At the same time, we have this mindset that if the modern west does not allow for these relationships to happen anyway, we should at least have the right to fuck as many mentally ill whores as we can and satisfy our primal desires, yet we can't, because we are undesirable.

The other main character, John Savage, reflects the desire of those who genuinely reject modern western society and seek a return to the values of the past. In the world of Brave New World, there still exist Indian (Native American) reservations which are some of the last places where people do not live a sterilized existence and where concepts such as father, mother and marriage still exist. The inhabitants of the 'civilized' world visit these places, much like people today may visit some tribal village in Africa, for their amusement and bewilderment. John's mother, Linda, was a member of the civilized world who visited such a place but got lost and injured herself and was taken into the society of the Indians. Because she was pregnant, she could not return because in the book's world, motherhood is considered shameful and disgusting and any woman would have gotten the child aborted before it came to actually giving birth. As a result, John, is raised as a white outsider between two conflicting worlds; the one his mother tells him about and which still controls her behaviour as she has sexual relationships with many of the Indian men and the traditional world of the Native Americans in which honour, God, love and death still mean something.

Bernard, intrigued by this story, asks John to come with him to London and John agrees, excited to see the marvels of technological development which his mother talked about during his childhood. But John quickly realizes that the civilized world was not exactly what he dreamed about, he is disgusted by the hedonism and lack of knowledge of the average person and can't keep up with the hyper-social system which forces everyone to always be in the company of others whereas he had been used to being alone in the desert. John also falls in love with earlier mentioned Lenina, who of course has a very different view of sex and relationships than he has. Lenina comes off onto him while John is trying to explain that he believes in marriage and wishes to wait for a good moment. Lenina doesn't listen and John, enraged by knowing that the woman he so loved is only interested in temporary carnal pleasure, beats her up while calling her a whore. I found this to be a very amusing segment because the utter confusion which Lenina exhibits in this segment seemed so similar to how women tend to behave in those videos where they get beaten up.
Eventually, he snaps when his mother dies in front of his eyes in a state hospital and a bunch of nurses and children mock his grief, as they are conditioned to treat death as a minor event and because they have no family, will never know what it feels like to lose something akin to a parent. He attempts to 'wake up' the low-caste workers outside of the hospital and holds a speech about how their whole lives are founded on lies but they do not understand what he is trying to stay due to being conditioned from birth to be content with this lifestyle and instead attack him. 

John is arrested and afterwards, decide to go full Kaczynski and live in a lighthouse and attempt to live off natural resources and devote the rest of his life to repenting for his mother's death and worshiping Christ. However, this attempt fails as people marvel at what they conceive as a barbaric lifestyle and come in droves to film him for their amusement. He attempted to escape civilization but civilization simply came back to him.

I could strongly relate to John as I live in the west but was raised in an Islamic household, the ancient values that I was brought up with of course strongly conflicted with the values of the society I participate in. This includes the views on sex and marriage, whereas Islam expects one to marry for life, westerners have already come to be used to a society where their future wives participated in gangbangs and can divorce them at any time for whatever reason. I also share some of his anti-technological views, as I am for example sick of the social media and smartphone culture that exists today, in which one is expected to be sharing absolutely everything he does.
I personally suspect John's character was inspired by Shakespeare's Othello (which is directly referenced many times by John himself, who is an avid fan of Shakespeare, which most people in this age have never heard of because his works were banned). Othello was a play about a Moorish (Muslim) general in the Venetian army who marries a Venetian Christian girl, who Othello suspects is cheating on him, after which Othello murders her. This may not have been Shakespeare's intent, but this to me reflects the more liberal attitude the west has always had regarding cheating and marriage compared to the very orthodox attitude in the Islamic world.


Concluding, when it comes to sexual relationships, we already live in Brave New World, this is why it's quite a depressing read at times. Many of either Bernard's or John's monologues made me think of emotional struggles I dealt with in life so far. 
Leave out the caste system and certain inventions like rocket-fueled public transport and this book might as well have been written by Michel Houellebecq. With the media's attempts at popularizing anti-monogamous fetishes like 'swinging' and women no longer having to marry because they can get financial stability by merely posting pictures of themselves online, it seems like monogamy and the concept of the nuclear family might already be on its death-row. At least in the west."

"Racepill Part 6 - Why women are inherently racist, Koinophilia and Neoteny",Blackpill,13k,"May 29, 2018",32000,101,"Wanna talk about this a little, @Facade 's tellemt tinder experiment caused some controversy. 

You guys don't understand how wicked and cruel female mind is. You just don't see it from a foid's perspective. 

The reason this forum still can't wrap their heads around the racepill is because they think like a man. But female brain is wired differently through hundreds of thousands years of foid evolution.

You, as a man, look at the face and make an unbiased facial aesthetics evaluation, but women do that evaluation based on different set of standards.
Women are inherently much more racist in mate selection due to many reasons. But the main one is biological and evolutionary.
Many data already show women are much more racially selective than men and they are all consistent regardless of source:











Why and how females are evolved to be more racist and vile than men ?

A- Women are slave to power and dominance. White race in the world are the more powerful and dominant race. We are living in a white man's world. They are biologically wired to seek out powerful males for protection of their off spring. Pierre L. Van Berghe (professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Washington and author of many books on race, sexuality, and human evolution) writes and I quote:

""Again, coercion is not a human monopoly. Male animals use force or threats to displace or eliminate competition, to gain access to females in oestrus. to secure submission of subordinates and so on. Some intelligent mammals, such as baboons and lions, are even capable of forming small coalitions of two to four males in order to establish and maintain a collective dominance over individual rivals. Some animal societies can thus be said to have rudimentary ""ruling classes.""

""Women’s judgments of men’s desirability were affected by dominant and altruistic behaviors. This research was built on a previous research study conducted by Sadalla, Kenrick, and Vershure (1987) that showed women were more attracted to men who exhibited dominant behavior. Sadalla et al. (1987) hypothesized that women’s preference for men who exhibited dominant behaviors were indicative of evolutionary influences, because male dominant behaviors conveyed reproductive advantages and the ability to access resources.""

White race signals power and status to women. They subconsciously think their offspring will face hardships if they mate with a man of inferior race.




B-Koinophilia

Koinophilia is an evolutionary hypothesis proposing that during sexual selection, animals preferentially seek mates with a minimum of unusual or mutant features, including functionality, appearance and behavior.

Donald Symons, professor emeritus of anthropology at UCSB and author of The Evolution of Human Sexuality, writes;


Mate choice actually comprises many different problems, so we should expect the evolution of many different mechanisms to solve them. E.g., what's the ideal amount of acne or other visible skin diseases in a potential mate? Presumably zero. So a psychological mechanism that follows the ""rule"": ""prefer unblemished skin, all else equal,"" would have been adaptive everywhere, and would develop in a relatively ""innate"" manner. What would have made adaptive sense is a mechanism that detects skin color in the individuals one sees growing up and specifies a rule ""prefer a mate with the average skin color you've seen.""
The effect of Koinophilia in females are much bigger as Pierre Van Den Bergh, professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Washington and author of many books on race, sexuality, and human evolution, says;


I believe the ""natural"" sexual preference is for partners who are broadly similar to oneself, in good physical condition, and in control of good resources, especially for women. Men tend to be more open to any mating opportunity, and to be less choosy.

C-Neoteny
Many of you have this misconception that neoteny is having subhuman recessed chin and weak jaw. But that isnt true. 







wiki says;
Neoteny is the delaying or slowing of the physiological (or somatic) development of an organism, typically an animal. Neoteny is found in modern humans.

It is directly linked to human attractiveness.
A quote from the study Sexual Selection, Physical Attractiveness, and Facial Neoteny: Cross-cultural Evidence and Implication

"".....A youthful or neotenous face is one that combines a high ratio of neurocranial to lower-facial features with a small nose and ears and full lips. The appendix gives a summary of a number of studies of neoteny and facial attractiveness""
""....In many animal species, male reproductive success is more dependent on mating success than is female reproductive success, so sexual selection commonly acts with greater intensity on males than on females
.....Among humans, considerable anatomical and behavioral evidence suggests that males have been subject to stronger sexual selection than females""

Long story short, neoteny is also associated with bigger frontal cortex in humans. Take a guess what are the most neotenous nations ?
Japan and northeast asia.
Outside Northeast Asia, the most neotenized people are of Northern European (Nordic, Celtic, Germanic) origin.

The more neotenous a race, the more intelligent and higher cranial capacity and neuroplasticity.















TLDR:
Women are biologically wired to seek out men of most powerful race. Women are gatekeepers to the reproduction and natural selection. Race is much less important issue for men than women Ethnic males are in disadvantage not only because their phenotype and features is considered ugly but also their race is associated with lower status and IQ.

LMS + Creep theory + Schopenhauer = reality (deal with it).,Untagged,PortraitOfTheAutist,"Nov 8, 2017",17000,49,"If you don't believe in LMS, Creep Theory, and Schopenhauer's refutation of free will, you are WRONG.

Here is creep theory, as explained by Henry Flynt:

When Helen Lefkowitz said I was ""such a creep"" at Interlochen in 1956, her remark epitomized the feeling that females have always had about me. My attempts to understand why females rejected me and to decide what to do about it resulted in years of confusion. In 1961-1962, I tried to develop a theory of the creep problem. This theory took involuntary celibacy as the defining characteristic of the creep. Every society has its image of the ideal young adult, even though the symbols of growing up change from generation to generation.The creep is an involuntary celibate because he fails to develop the surface traits of adulthood--poise and sophistication; and because he is shy, unassertive, and lacks self-confidence in the presence of others . The creep is awkward and has an unstylish appearance. He seems sexless and childish. He is regarded by the ideal adults with condescending scorn, amusement, or pity. 

Because he seems weak and inferior in the company of others, and cannot maintain his self-respect, the creep is pressed into isolation. There, the creep doesn't have the pressure of other people's presence to make him feel inferior, to make him feel that he must be like them in order not to be inferior. The creep can develop the morale required to differ. The creep also tends to expand his fantasy life, so that it takes the place of the interpersonal life from which he has been excluded. The important consequence is that the creep is led to discover a number of positive personality values which cannot be achieved by the mature, married adult. During, the period when I developed the creep theory, I was spending almost all of my time alone in my room, thinking and writing. This fact should make the positive creep values more understandable. 

1. Because of his isolation, the creep has a qualitatively higher sense of identity. He has a sense of the boundaries of his personality, and a control of what goes on within those boundaries. In contrast, the mature adult, who spends all his time with his marriage partner or in groups of people, is a mere channel into which thoughts flow from outside; he lives in a state of conformist anonymity. 

2. The creep is emotionally autonomous, independent, or self-contained. He develops an elaborate world of feelings which remain within himself, or directed toward inanimate objects. The creep may cooperate with other people in work situations , but he does not develop emotional attachments to other people 

3. Although the creep's intellectual abilities develop with education, the creep lives in a sexually neutral world and a child's world throughout his life. He is thus able to play like a child. He retains the child's capacity for make believe. He retains the child's lyrical creativity in regard to self-originated, self justifying activities. 

4. There is enormous room in the creep's life for the development of every aspect of the inner world or the inner life. The creep can devote himself to thought, fantasy, imagination, imaging, variegated mental states, dreams, internal emotions and feelings towards inanimate objects. The creep develops his inner world on his own power. His inner life originates with himself, and is controlled and intellectually consequential. The creep has no use for meditations whose content is supplied by religious traditions. Nor has he any use for those drug experiences which adolescents undertake to prove how grown up they are, and whose content is supplied by fashion. The creep's development of his inner life is the summation of all the positive creep values. 


After describing these values, the creep theory returned to the problem of the creep's involuntary celibacy. For, physical reasons, the creep remains a captive audience for the opposite sex, but his attempts to gain acceptance by the opposite sex always ends in failure. On the other hand, the creep may well find the positive creep values so desirable that he will want to intensify them. The solution is for the creep to seek a medical procedure which will sexually neutralize him. He can then attain the full creep values, without the disability of an unresolved physical desire. 

Actually, the existence of the positive creep values proves that the creep is an authentic non-human who happens to be trapped in human socialbiology. The positive creep values imply a specification of a whole non-human social biology which would be appropriate to those values. Finally, the creep theory mentioned that creeps often make good grades in school, and can thus do clerical work or other work useful to humans. This fact would be the basis for human acceptance of the creep. 

In the years after I presented the creep theory, a number of inadequacies became apparent in it. The principal one was that I managed to cast off the surface traits of the creep, but that when I did my problem became even more intractable. An entirely different analysis of the problem was required. 

My problem actually has to do with the enormous discrepancy between the ways I can relate to males and the ways I can relate to females. The essence of the problem has to do with the social values of females, which are completely different from my own. The principal occupation of my life has been certain self-originated activities which are embodied in ""writings."" Now most males have the same social values that I find in all females. But there have always been a few males with exceptional values; and my activities have developed through exchanges of ideas with these males. These exchanges have come about spontaneously and naturally. In contrast, I have never had such an exchange of ideas with females, for the following reasons. Females have nothing to say that applies to my activities. They cannot understand that such activities are possible. Or they are a part of the ""masses"" who oppose and have tried to discourage my activities. 

The great divergence between myself and females comes in the area where each individual is responsible for what he or she is; the area in which one must choose oneself and the principles with which one will be identified. This area is certainly not a matter of intelligence or academic degrees. Further, the fact that society has denied many opportunities to females at one time or another is not involved here. (My occupation has no formal prerequisites, no institutional barriers to entry. One enters it by defining oneself as being in it. Yet no female has chosen to enter it. Or consider such figures as Galileo and Galois. By the standards of their contemporaries, these individuals were engaged in utterly ridiculous, antisocial pursuits. Society does not give anybody the ""opportunity"" to engage in such pursuits. Society, tries to prevent everybody from being a Galileo or Galois. To be a Galileo is really a matter of choosing sides, of choosing to take a certain stand.) 

Let me be specific about my own experiences. When I distributed the prospectus for The Journal of Indeterminate Mathematical Investigations to graduate students at the Courant Institute in the fall of 1967, the most negative reactions came from the females. The mere fact that I wanted to invent a mathematics outside of academic mathematics was in and of itself offensive and revolting to them. Since the academic status of these females was considerably higher than my own, the disagreement could only be considered one of values. 

The field of art provides an even better example, because there are many females in this field. In the summer of 1969 I attended a meeting of the women's group of the Art Workers Coalition in New York. Many of the women there had seen my Down With Art pamphlet. All the females who have seen this pamphlet have reacted negatively, and it is quite clear what their attitude is. They believe that they are courageously defending modern art against a philistine. They consider me to be a crank who needs a ""modern museum art appreciation course."" The more they are pressed, the more proudly do they defend ""Great Art."" Now the objective validity of my opposition to art is absolutely beyond question. To defend modern art is precisely what a hopeless mediocrity would consider courageous. Again, it is clear that the opposition between myself and females is in the area where one must choose one's values. 

I have found that what I really have to do to make a favorable impression on females is to conceal or suspend my activities - the most important part of my life; and to adopt a facade of conformity. Thus, I perceive females as persons who cannot function in my occupation. I perceive them as being like an employment agency, like an institution to which you have to present a conformist facade. Females can be counted on to represent the most social, human"" point of view, a point of view which, as I have explained, is distant from my own. (In March 1970, at the Institute for Advanced Study, the mathematician Dennis Johnson said to me that he would murder his own mother, and murder all his friends, if by doing so he could get the aliens to take him to another star and show him a higher civilization. My own position is the same as Johnson's.) 

It follows that my perception of sex is totally different from that of others. The depictions of sex in the mass media are completely at variance with my own experience. I object to pornography in particular because it is like deceptive advertising for sex; it creates the impression that the physical aspect of sex can be separated from human personalities and social interaction. Actually, if most people can separate sex from personality, it is because they are so average that their values are the same as everybody else's. In my case, although I am a captive audience for females for physical reasons, the disparity between my values and theirs overrides the physical attraction. I feel for them. It is hard enough to present a facade of conformity in order to deal with an employment agency, but the thought of having to maintain such a facade in a more intimate relationship is 
completely demoralizing. 

What conclusions can be drawn by comparing the creep theory with my later experience? First, some individuals who are unquestionably creeps asfar as the surface traits are concerned simply may not be led to the deeper values I described. They may not have the talent to get anything positive out of their involuntary situation ; or their aspirations may be so conformist that they do not see their involuntary situation as a positive opportunity. Many creeps are female, but all the evidence indicates that they have the same values I have attributed to other females--values which are hard to reconcile with the deeper creep values. 

As for the positive creep values, I may have had them even before I began to care about whether females accepted me. For me, these values may have been the cause, not the effect, of surface creepiness. They are closely related to the values that underlie my activities. It is not necessary to appear strangely dressed, childish, unassertive, awkward, and lacking in confidence in order to achieve the positive creep values. (I probably emphasized surface creep traits during my youth in order to dissociate myself from conformist opinion at a time when I hadn't yet had the chance to make a full substantive critique of it.) Even sex, in and of itself, might not be incompatible with the creep inner life; what makes it incompatible is the female personality and female social values, which in real life cannot be separated from sex and are the predominant aspect of it. 

Having cast off the surface traits of the creep, I can now see that whether I make a favorable impression on females really depends on whether I conceal my occupation. Celibacy is an effect of my occupation; it does not have the role of a primary cause that the creep theory attributed. to it. However, it does have consequences of its own. In the context of the entire situation I have described, it constitutes an absolute dividing line between myself and humanity. It does seem to be closely related to the deeper creep values, especially the one of living in a child's world. 

As for the sexual neutralization advocated in the creep theory, to find a procedure which actually achieves the stated objective without having all sorts of unacceptable side effects would be an enormous undertaking. It is not feasible as a minor operation developed for a single person. Further, as the human species comes to have vast technological capabilities, many special interest groups will want to tinker with human social biology, each in a different way, for political reasons. I am no longer interested in petty tinkering with human biology. As I make it clear in other writings, I am in favor of building entities which are actially superior to humans, and which avoid the whole fabric of human biosocial defects, not just one or two of them."
Celibacy Rate is at least 25% for men under 26 years old,Blackpill,RageAgainstTDL,"May 6, 2018",28000,100,"We know that 15% of men 22-35 have had no sex in the past year:






Now we also know that 13-17% of all 26 year olds are virgins. That's pooled for both men and women. Men would have higher virginity rates than women, so that implies at least ~20% virginity rate for men.

At a minimum, there are at least another 5-10% of guys who have gotten laid once in their life but never again and are thus still generally celibate. 

This means there is a minimum of 25% celibacy rate for men under 26 years old. Possibly the rate is already as high as 30%+.

We are already much closer to Japan than people think.

Blackpill straight from the horse's mouth,Blackpill,Deleted member 26010,"Mar 3, 2021",13000,33,"Here is an article on the importance of men's looks and dark triad traits for gene selection in reproduction. Backed by study conducted in Germany.

Link: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/head-games/201305/the-allure-aggressive-men

A few excerpts from the article written by a foid psychologist:

""Aside from a man’s resources, his genetic gifts are decisive in the selection process.""

""Research has established that, generally speaking, women must choose between two types of men: dads and cHads. On the one hand, dads are typically more commitment-oriented, warm, faithful, and reliable. Yet they are usually less handsome, charismatic, and dominant than his cHaddish counterparts. On the other hand, cHads are sexier, with their narrow eyes and strong jaws—but they also tend to be flashy and exploitative of others. Even worse, these masculine men often embody the Dark Triad, a personality constellation that encompasses Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and narcissism. So, what in the world is appealing about these objectionable individuals? Quite simply, they possess high-quality genes that they will pass down to their future children. In turn, the thinking goes, women will maximize their reproductive success by choosing a macho man as a short-term mate for his genes, and a less masculine man with a warmer personality for a long-term, invested partner.

However, ovulation can make the choice between dads and cHads particularly challenging. Research has revealed that during ovulation, women show a weakness for masculine men with high-quality genes. Studies consistently show that fertile women prefer men who display macho facial features and social dominance. In other words, they like bad boys. Building on these findings, Gilda Biebel of the University of Konstanz and her colleagues reasoned that evolution may have also favored men who went to war. Consequently, they wondered if aggression might also be a signal of genetic fitness.""

""What can we learn from this study and related efforts? While it may be bewildering why a woman would fall for the charms of a bellicose man, there's an underlying logic that seems to explain at least part of it: She wants to extract his good genes for posterity. The research also uncovers that the attraction to socially dominant men isn't just psychological—it's undergirded by biology. So while the appeal of an aggressive man may be confusing on an emotional level, an evolutionary lens can bring these tangled motivations into clearer focus."""
Concealed ovulation - Women's evolutionary adaptation to cheat on men with chads and fraud paternity,Blackpill,Gymcelled,"Mar 11, 2021",11000,36,"tl;dr Concealed ovulation is an evolutionary adaptation that occurs among female humans (and that is rather rare in nature) that allows them to cheat, have sex with Chad and fraud paternity. This adaptation was partly driven by women prostituting themselves for food and other goods/advantages. This straight up comes from a wikipedia article citing scientific studies

 I will by mostly just quoting the wikipedia article, I can't believe this article is even up on such a mainstream platform.

Spoiler: Definition of concealed ovulation







Concealed ovulation or hidden estrus in a species is the lack of any perceptible change in an adult female (for instance, a change in appearance or scent) when she is fertile and near ovulation. Some examples of perceptible changes are swelling and redness of the genitalia in baboons and bonobos, and pheromone release in the feline family. In contrast, the females of humans and a few other species[1] that undergo hidden estrus have few external signs of fecundity, making it difficult for a mate to consciously deduce, by means of external signs only, whether or not a female is near ovulation.

 Concealed ovulation allows women to breed with genetically superior men (aka chads)



Cuckoldry hypothesis

Click to expand...





Schroder in his review writes that Benshoof and Thornhill hypothesized that estrus became hidden after monogamous relationships became the norm in Homo erectus.[14] Concealed ovulation allowed the woman to mate secretly at times with a genetically superior man, and thus gain the benefit of his genes for her offspring, while still retaining the benefits of the pair bond with her usual sexual partner. Her usual sexual partner would have little reason to doubt her fidelity, because of the concealed ovulation, and would have high, albeit unfounded, paternity confidence in her offspring. His confidence would encourage him to invest his time and energy in assisting her to care for the child, even though it was not his own. Again, the idea of a man's investment being vital to the child's survival is a central fixture of a hypothesis regarding concealed ovulation, even as the evolutionary benefits accrue to the child, the woman, and her clandestine partner, and not to her regular sexual partner.

 Concealed ovulation stops men from realizing they were cucked and from killing the bastard kids



Reduced infanticide hypothesis

Click to expand...





This hypothesis suggests the adaptive advantage for women who had hidden estrus would be a reduction in the possibility of infanticide by men, as they would be unable to reliably identify, and kill, their rivals' offspring.[14] This hypothesis is supported by recent studies of wild Hanuman langurs, documenting concealed ovulation, and frequent matings with males outside their fertile ovulatory period.[21] Heistermann et al. hypothesize that  concealed ovulation is used by women to confuse paternity and thus reduce infanticide in primates. He explains that as ovulation is always concealed in women, men can only determine paternity (and thus decide on whether to kill the woman's child) probabilistically, based on his previous mating frequency with her, and so he would be unable to escape the possibility that the child might be his own, even if he were aware of promiscuous matings on the woman's part.

 Concealed ovulation was partly born out of prostitution



Sex and reward hypothesis

Click to expand...





Schoroder[14] reviews a hypothesis by Symons and Hill, that after hunting, men exchanged meat for sex with women. Women who continuously mimicked estrus may have benefited from more meat than those that did not. If this occurred with enough frequency, then a definite period of estrus would have been lost, and with it sexual signaling specific to ovulation would have disappeared.

Click to expand...


 Women LARPed as ovulating to get what they wanted. They LARPed so much it altered their genetics through evolution and gave birth to concealed ovulation

This isn't much different from modern women who LARP as ovulating through the use of make up

Lastly I would like to point out that concealed ovulation goes hand in hand with other things such as: women having the brain structure of compulsive liars and the fact that 10% of children nowadays are the result of cuckoldry (frauded paternity).

 It's absolutely undeniable that women have evolutionary adaptations geared towards cheating, which also shows how prevalent cheating was throughout history (and still is)

 The last 2 hypothesis are less interesting but still worth reading imo, check the next spoiler if you're interested



Spoiler: Paternal and social hypothesis



Paternal investment hypothesis​



The paternal investment hypothesis is strongly supported by many evolutionary biologists.[14] Several hypotheses regarding human evolution integrate the idea that women increasingly required supplemental paternal investment in their offspring. The shared reliance on this idea across several hypotheses concerning human evolution increases its significance in terms of this specific phenomenon.

This hypothesis suggests that women concealed ovulation to obtain men's aid in rearing offspring. Schoroder[14] summarizes this hypothesis outlined in Alexander and Noonan's 1979 paper: if women no longer signaled the time of ovulation, men would be unable to detect the exact period in which they were fecund. This led to a change in men's mating strategy: rather than mating with multiple women in the hope that some of them, at least, were fecund during that period, men instead chose to mate with a particular woman repeatedly throughout her menstrual cycle. A mating would be successful in resulting in conception when it occurred during ovulation, and thus, frequent matings, necessitated by the effects of concealed ovulation, would be most evolutionarily successful. A similar hypothesis was proposed by Lovejoy in 1981 that argued that concealed ovulation, reduced canines and bipedalism evolved from a reproductive strategy where males provisioned food resources to his paired female and dependent offspring.[17][18]

Click to expand...





Continuous female sexual receptivity suggests human sexuality is not solely defined by reproduction; a large part of it revolves around conjugal love and communication between partners. Copulations between partners while the woman is pregnant or in the infertile period of her menstrual cycle do not achieve conception, but do strengthen the bond between these partners. Therefore, the increased frequency of copulations due to concealed ovulation are thought to have played a role in fostering pair bonds in humans.

Click to expand...

 It's funny that they say that a woman having repeated sex with you makes you like her more and strengthens your bonds with her yet we're told to be happy to be treated as sexless drones by every woman we interact.




Schroder[14] presents the idea of a ""gradual diminution of mid-cycle estrus and concomitant continuous sexual receptivity in human women"" because it facilitated orderly social relationships throughout the menstrual cycle by eliminating the periodic intensification of male–male aggressiveness in competition for mates.[14] The extended estrous period of the bonobo (reproductive-age females are in heat for 75% of their menstrual cycle) has been said to have a similar effect to the lack of a ""heat"" in women. While concealed human ovulation may have evolved in this fashion, extending estrus until it was no longer a distinct period, as paralleled in the bonobo, this theory of why concealed ovulation evolved has frequently been rejected. Schroder outlines the two objections to this hypothesis: (1) natural selection would need to work at a level above the individual, which is difficult to prove; and (2) selection, because it acts on the individuals with the most reproductive success, would thus favor greater reproductive success over social integration at the expense of reproductive success.

The Blackpill Manual – Reasons Why It’s Over & Answers,It's Over,Deleted member 30146,"Oct 18, 2020",20000,45,"Been lurking on this forum for many years, decided to share some wisdom. I’m an oldcel, an avid student of the blackpill.

In this thread I’ll try to break the blackpill on a more in-depth level. As paradoxically as it might sound, it will be a big ropefuel and copefuel at the same time for anyone reading it till the end. It will put things into place, especially for those who’re living in the West.

When talking about the blackpill side of male/female relations we need to consider 3 things:

Society / The Current Times We Live In.

Societal norms and cultural expectations aren’t like they used to be 10, 20, 100, 300 years ago. Most incels today wouldn’t of be incels 100 years ago.

Yourself

What you can offer in terms of looks, status and money (more on the latter 2 later…).

Different times would of required different ‘stats’. 10000 years ago no one would gave a shit about how ugly your face is, if you were tall and strong by dominating other men you could of just taken any foid you want, foids would of naturally preferred you because you could protect and provide for them, not that they had any choice ether, the choice was non-existent. The strong would dominate the weak and take what’s rightfully theirs.

Foids

Foids most important qualities are youth and beauty.

What do foids want?

Provision (food, shelter)
Protection (security, safety)
Intimate relationships (with males that have the best genes a.k.a Chads)
With the first two, for the most part taken care of the police and government (with your tax dollars cuck)







https://thenewmodernman.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/cumul.jpg



leaves us with 1 thing – intimate relationships with Chads.


The 2 Things That a Male Might Want From a Foid Are:


Part A. Sex.
Part B. Bonding/Affection

Part A. Sex

Emptying your balls is one of the highest pleasures in life. Most achieve it 2 ways:

Fapping
Fucking a women
Fucking a women is the more pleasurable and preferred option, here where things get interesting. You can achieve it 2 ways:

Pay For It

Provided you would use an escort that would provide same experience as you would get from free sex, in terms of her acting etc, it would be the same experience in terms of bodily pleasure, as unpaid sex.

You would get:

Sex
You wouldn’t get:

Validation (ego boost)
You would have to part with $100-$200 (in the West)

You can pay for sex to get 1/2 things that you want from foids. Let’s say your sexual drive is cumming 10 times a month, that’s $2k/m, which is likely a lot of money to YOU.

Average salary in US is $43k after taxes, that’s about $3,500 every month. To get your need of sex fulfilled on a regular basis you would have to spend over 50% of your monthly income.

Now imagine you’re a doctor/lawyer and make $200k after taxes, or $16,000 every month. Paying $2k/m you would be spending only 12.5% of your monthly income.

If you made that much, ordering sex on tap would be same as ordering a pizza, it wouldn’t be such a big deal paying for sex, because it’s cheap to YOU.

In US an escort that charged $500 for her services, can be had for $50 in Ukraine, so you need to be making the required amount of money where the expense of paying for pussy is negligible (making 16k/m spending $2k in US, or making 3k/m spending $500 in Ukraine, etc.)

Inb4 - “paying for pussy is cucked”, yes, if you get $1000/m in welfare paying $200 for an escort is cucked and stupid, you shouldn’t be doing that, but what if it costed same price as a 2L coca-cola bottle? Would you pay for it? That’s basically the price the above doctors and lawyers are paying, it’s same for them as buying a 2L coca-cola bottle for a neetbuxxer.

Get It For “Free”.

In what cases foids would be giving up sex for free:

Finding you attractive and wanting to have sex with you for the share pleasure of it.
Wanting something from you - financial provision (betabuxxing), advancing her career (fucking a boss or higher up), she wants to get famous (Hugh Hefner, Dan Bilzerian, famous 60yr old actors dating 18yr olds, etc) . Paying for sex and this option are similar in a sense that only the option A of “what do you want from a foid” would be fulfilled, without the added benefit of an ego boost.
80% of foids find 20% of men average or above average in terms of looks.





being in those top 20% as a male doesn’t mean that you’re attractive in women’s eyes, it simply means that you’re average/above average. If a 7/10 is ‘average’ to them, imagine how subhuman a 4-5 look in their eyes. Not only this, tinder and other dating apps alike, have up to x3 more males than females on them.

""But how bad it actually is?"" -You ask.

If you happen to be eating right now, put that fork and knife away, or else you’ll feel an uncontrollable urge to do a harakiri after watching this video:



To cover the first part in the “2 things that a male might want from a foid”

You need to ether:

Be a Chad (to all bluepillers reading this and saying “why he’s going to such extremes, I’m not a chad and had/have a GF, pat yourself on the back- you had unpaid sex, but the chances that she loved/loves you are close to 0, and I’ll be discussing why that’s the case later on)
Be a famous celebrity, sportsman, drug cartel boss (status maxxed)
Be a betabuxxer for a rostie. (rope yourself already)
Pay for escorts (can be a lifefuel if you’re in the top 10% of earners in your country)
What about the part of “foids finding you attractive and wanting to have sex with you for the share pleasure of it.” -You ask.

When having free sex it comes with a women validating you as a man (ego boost), which gives you a different type of pleasure than a mare sex, as oppose to paid sex and option 2.

Do not, and I repeat DO NOT confuse ego validation through unpaid sex and bonding/affection. That’s the biggest mistake a man can make.

With unpaid sex, it’s only that - your ego. You fucking an escort and the same escort fucking some guy from a club for free are the SAME things in terms of bodily pleasure, except you don’t get your ego stroked as she’s doing it not because she’s into you, but because she gets paid.

“Chad doesn’t have to, the tinder foids come to his house and go down straight to fucking“ -You say.

You would have to be 1% in terms of looks to make that happen, even if you’re a lower tier Chad you still have to keep them entertained (jestermaxx) for an hour or two before the sex happens, then on top of that you need to have a thick dick and do an outstanding performance in bed to get “repeated customers”.

If you could, would rather pay the price of a 2L coca-cola bottle, and use her as a human fleshlight, than have to go through all of that bullshit of getting it for free to only get that “ego boost”, what would you choose?

We covered the purely “sex” part, now let’s talk about long term relationships.

With Part B. Bonding/Affection, the ego boost is included by default. But is it achievable?


Part B. Bonding/Affection

Bonding/Affection - biological want to provide/take care of a female and get affection in return, you can call it “love”. Most want to bond and feel affection more than the sex itself.

""Romantic love is considerably stronger than the sex drive."" Fisher, 2004 citation

Sexual Desire, Affection and Respect (respect and love are mutual, if a women doesn’t respect you she can’t love you).

The biggest question is - can a modern female give you the romantic love - affection, validation and respect that you desire? Societal norms and religion form/hold the values and mold the behavior of foids such as being feminine and submissiveness, they also curb promiscuity.

“After the Reformation, citizens were not only expected to adhere to the official brand of Christianity but to maintain the highest standards of Christian behaviour: to be sober, chaste, compliant and conscientious. Some historians have identified the period from the middle of the sixteenth century to the Civil War in the 1640s as being particularly hazardous for women because a general obsession with social disorder meant they were under enormous pressure to conform to accepted gender roles.” citation

Indeed, encouraging foids to not be degenerates was hazardous, according to cucked historians. JFL

The glue that holds the society is (or should I say was) the religion, ongoing deterioration of the social fabric and norms of what’s accepted and not accepted has been completely destroyed in most countries. I’m a non believer myself, but I just state the fact that the low IQ masses desperately need religion to keep even the basic moral principles and keeping society from falling apart, look at what the west has become…?


Women’s Sexual Partner Count and Ability To Pair Bond


“When individuals fall in love for the first time they can find enjoyment in having a partner that gives them a feeling of completeness. The relationship sets the stage for the merging of two beings, closer than the bonds of friendship. Each individual is in tune with the feelings and moods of the other, not feeling completely whole without the other.” citation

When you say you want a virgin I understand, but is it because:

You’re a virgin yourself.
You want an ego boost from having a virgin.
You want her to be ‘pure’.

Any of the above answer is fine by me, but the real reason why you would want a virgin is not because of any of the above, but because her sexual partner count greatly affects her ability to bond/feel affection (which is the main thing that most of us want).

“Above all else do you want to marry a woman who has voluntarily accepted being used as a cum dumpster by other men, or who kisses your child with lips that have been previously wrapped around many other cocks?” NO!


Let’s Look at The Science and Data






https://ifstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/wolfinger-sex-divorce-table-1.png





The chances of marrying a virgin was 5% in a pre-tinder era, in 2020? 1% at best.

Female psyche was not made for having multiple sexual partners without getting her short circuits fried. The more sexual partners she has the lesser the ability to pair bond and be affectionate (in its truest sense) becomes.

Some argue that the brains get completely shorted after having more than 5-10 sexual partners, Einstein IQ anon said:

“This means that she will always compare her feelings that she is getting from you at the moment with the feelings that she got from other partners in the past. So, if she had several strong emotional connections with other partners, it is really hard to match up even if you are objectively (in looks, attitude, status etc) the best she ever had.

If a man wants to marry, his must find a woman that is either a virgin or low notch count (She should not have passed the rubricock threshhold: the sufficient number of partners until she finds her first chad that gives her extreme tingles and then dumps her, after him she is a lost cause…)”

I beg to differ and say IT’S OVER as soon as the digit hits 1.

If you’re her second one before you get married, the likelihood of divorce increases from 6% (virgin wife) to…how much…? 5%... maybe 10%... ? Not so fast buddy boyo, it merely goes up 4 times, you god damn right, the chances of divorce goes up 400%, from 6% to 22%.






https://ifstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/wolfinger-sex-partners-divorce-figure-1-1.png




For females the bond with her first romantic partner is something special in more ways than she can imagine, first time experiences of romantic love have heightened sensations from having someone to be completely open with and with whom she can share all her dreams, hopes and fears. THE SECOND TIME IS NOT


What Does The Science Say About It?

“These emotional and hormonal imprints of first love (at a time when our brains are in such an important growing stage or peak) cause life-long effects not only to our psyche but our biology as well.” Helen Fisher's 2005 fMRI study.

“First love takes longer to heal and leaves an “imprint” on the sensory areas of your brain”

“All of these feelings and experiences we had with our first loves then become a ""blueprint"" for how we approach relationships later on in our lives. In other words, our personal definition of love is based upon everything we went through with our firsts.“ - Dr. Dardashti citation

Think about it, why marrying a virgin .vs marrying someone with 1 notch count has that much of a difference?

Is it because you’re not her first one and she compares you .vs him or anyone other previous partner before, or could it be that you wasn’t the one who caused the life-long effects that affected her psyche and biology, in ways that the current science only beginning go grasp?

WARNING: STOP READING IF YOU’RE ON THE BRINK OF ROPING


“According to Dr. Dardashti, people often compare their current relationship to their first love in order to determine if their feelings for their current partner align with that definition of love they created from their first experience with it. Because the romantic feelings we had for our first loves felt so great, we want to duplicate them, to experience them again and again with as many people as possible.”

“The fact that these women are in more developed relationships doesn't rid them of the pleasure that arises from remembering their first real taste of pure, unfettered desire.

So, perhaps a first love really is the deepest. For one, first loves seem to help us craft our definition of love -- which, as we all know, varies from person to person. And this definition appears to be the one off which we've based all of our relationships.

Throughout our romantic lives, the emotions we felt for our first loves have acted as a standard for every subsequent love. And even though those loves came and went, and even though that first one faded into the past, the standard remained. In that sense, perhaps a first love is the deepest in a literal way.” source

Add up all the scientific data you’ve read and take into account the chart of divorce chances increasing by 400% if she has 1 notch count, what conclusions can you make?

Her “Love” Short Circuits Are Fried.

If she’s not a virgin she will never love you. You might think that she loves you, she might think that she loves you, but as we already established, the love she had for her first romantic partner is different, it’s “pure”.

Even for a Chad finding a virgin in the West would be a daunting task and for us IT’S TRULLY OVER. 


Relationships Old .vs Modern

Back in the olden days you would ether be in an arranged marriage or a marriage of convenience and get a virgin submissive wife.

“Sexuality for the medieval woman began before marriage as a young virgin. It was not necessary for her to be beautiful to be married off because marriage was traditionally based on politics, material wealth, and social status. It would have been intensely disapproved of for a man and woman to marry based on physical attraction or love. When a family made a match for the daughter, choosing a mate based on sexual attraction was never considered. It was very rare to find references to love and beauty in the negotiations for marriage between two families.”

“A man was supposed to transform his wife from a virgin to a woman by consummating the marriage, ideally with a pregnancy.”

“The act of adultery was considered by far the worst of sexual sins, but it is noteworthy that usually only women would be punished for it. A husband would be forbidden to murder his adulterous wife, but if he did, the courts were reluctant to punish him.” Based AF?

“The ultimate purity for the Church was for one to maintain virginity throughout one's life, but if one must have a sexual life, it would then only be legitimate for procreation through marriage.”  citation





Once again, religion keeping hoes in check from hoeing. Don’t forget that IT’S OVER for Christianity in the West, the only way you can get a virgin wife is if you ether Islammaxx and find a virgin wife in a 3rd world country or Christianitymaxx somewhere in an small Philippines village where there’s no access to JBW’s to local foids.

150 years ago “Women were expected to have sex with only one man, her husband.“ “If a woman had sexual contact with another man, she was seen as ""ruined"" or ""fallen"". Citation

Societal norms keeping hoes in check.

In today’s society there are no checks and balances, you can be coming home from work and find your wife being spit-roasted by 2 chads, if you divorce her she’ll get the house, child support and alimony and you’ll be sleeping in a car and paying her through your ass (or end up in jail for missing a child support payment and pay with your ass literally).


Marrying in today’s day and age is cucked and any of you that happen to ascend in the future who do get marred while knowing the blackpill, you deserve everything you’ll get.

The uglier you are the more it’s required of you to keep the relationship going

Keeping her entertained, jestermaxxing, betabuxxing are just a few of the things that normies do, and the uglier you are the more you have to ‘bring to the table’.


IT’S OVER, WHAT CAN I DO NEXT?

Solution For Part A. Sex:


Moneymaxx and then escortmaxx, to the point where paying for an escort is same for you as buying a 2L coca-cola bottle for a peasant is.
Gold-diggermaxxing: flashing your wealth, pretending that you’re looking for a long term relationship/marriage, attracting gold-diggers, fucking and tossing them out like the used-up hoes that they are.
Betabuxxing: if you earn average bucks, when you become older, it’s likely you will end up as a betabuxxing for an old, used up, single mother who’s only after your money. It’s not a solution, and you should feel deeply ashamed of yourself if you end up in this category.
How to moneymaxx?

Get a degree in a field where salaries are high: lawyer, doctor, engineer.
Learn how to code, there are plenty of remote jobs, and then move to SEA or any other 3rd world shithole.
If you’re too low IQ/lazy to learn how to code, but from an English speaking country then become a freelancer, offering cold calling or content writing services. I personally know a guy from US who lives in SEA and makes a good income from cold calling, if 1000’s of other people can do it, so can you!

Solution For Part B. Bonding/Affection and Validation:

In this researched and science based thread we established that if she’s not a virgin she will never love you.

The the only way you can get a virgin wife is if you ether Islammaxx and find a virgin wife in a 3rd world country or Christianitymaxx somewhere in a small Philippines village where there’s no access to JBW’s to local foids.

You can’t bring her back to the West ether, even though the chances of a breakup/divorce are greatly reduced if she’s a virgin, bringing her to the West would change the playing field from traditional uncucked society to a Western ceasspit of moral degeneracy, if you don’t want to risk her mind being corrupted by this, after the marriage you have to stay in THAT country.


Knowing that’s it’s TRULLY OVER, is liberating after you come to terms with it. 

If you want to rope on the spot after reading this thread, don’t. With time it’ll get better and after enough time you’ll come to accept that there’s nothing you can do to get romantic love in the West and the only way to get it is to change your life in ways that most just won’t (moving to a 3rd world shithole and staying there).

You can’t change the way you were born, you can’t change the way your face looks like. The only thing in your control are the decisions you make everyday, moneymaxxing is the only legit cope that’s left to us.

"The selective endorsement of retribution, and the hypocritical notion of ""justice""",Discussion,Deleted member 8353,"Sep 29, 2019",6000,9,"I'd like to take a moment to explore a couple simple, hypothetical situations.

A young boy's life is taken from him due to the actions of a murderer, and the manner of his death was particularly cruel. He was subdued on the outskirts of the town in which he lived, dragged some distance into a forest, and was then stabbed dozens of times while he was fully conscious, until (and for some time after) his eventual death. In this case, the teenager (substantially older than our aforementioned boy) who carried out the murder is found and brought to trial.

Eventually our killer is convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, however at the sentencing, the murderer is given a chance to speak to the boy's family. He proceeds to claim that his attack on the boy was inspired by pure rage, yet it wasn't focused on his victim in particular, but that he simply lost all control and stopped caring about the consequences of his actions, both in regards to himself and others. He also claims that prior to him carrying out the murder, he had been contemplating suicide, which is what eventually led him to wander out of his house with a pocket knife in the first place.

Afterwards, during the time in which the family of the boy is allowed to speak to the killer, the courtroom looks upon the boy's father. The father states, in no uncertain terms, that he doesn't believe the killer's explanation, and feels no sympathy for him regardless. He goes on to say that, given knowledge of his violent murder of a young boy, other inmates will likely make great efforts to torture, rape, and potentially murder his son's killer, and that he takes great comfort in this.

Lets say that for the sake of this hypothetical, we can know with certainty that both the murderer and the father are being entirely genuine.

I'll give you another one.

In this case there is a man, probably in a similar situation to many of us here. He was unattractive all throughout his life, and suffered all of the problems associated with this. He grew up without a father, his mother made no effort to teach him how to be an adult, or really teach him anything useful whatsoever, and perhaps treated him in a similar manner to a pet. Throughout his childhood and adolescence, he was continuously bullied and ostracized by his supposed peers at a government school. The teachers did nothing to stop this, and often resorted to essentially punishing him for being bullied, presumably because it was easier. 

After high school, he went on to university, but his efforts to find acceptance and intimacy were still in vain. By this point he was more or less emotionally destroyed from a decade of bullying and rejection, and he no longer had the capacity to continue his education, so he dropped out. A few years later he was no better off, a man without a decent job, with no experience of sex or romance in his life, and with no real hope for the future. He absolutely hated society for what he had experienced, and decided that he would take revenge upon society to gain at least some measure of cathartic satisfaction.

He then procured a firearm, went to his local shopping mall, and proceeded shoot people at random until his inevitable suicide.

So I ask, would you declare either of these scenarios to be an example of justice being served? 

Lets go back to the first hypothetical. While it's certainly simplified, the point I'm trying to make here is that carrying out the punishment of criminals for it's own sake is no better than any other sadistic assault on another human, it's only differentiated through legality, and through the concepts of laws or rules. You can extrapolate this logic to all that encompasses punitive justice. The problem is of course, how exactly are you justified in your application of suffering upon another if human action is merely the product of behavioral conditioning? How can you inflict suffering upon someone for breaking an established rule if people have no real control of their own in regards to whether or not they follow it?

I mean according to literally all of the evidence, this is most likely the exact nature of the situation, meanwhile the only possible defense of free will would be some mystical, undefinable, and unproven intuition. At the very least, we can say with certainty that the universe around us is deterministic, and that people are heavily influenced by their environment. So then, given all of this, since the killer has been shown to be dangerous and emotionally unstable, wouldn't the appropriate action be to execute him as quickly and painlessly as possible, as to prevent him from harming others, and prevent him from going through pointless torture which produces nothing?

What I'm saying is that I don't see any difference between the sentiment of the boy's father, and that of the killer himself. Both reacted emotionally and took their anger out on someone else in an unproductive way, it's just that the father's manner of revenge is tolerated by the judicial system, while the killer's is prosecuted. 

Much of the same also applies to the latter hypothetical. While it's true that our khhv incel had been treated unfairly throughout his life, people have no true control in how they respond to others, and his romantic failings can be entirely attributed to genetic determinism. So then, how is it reasonable to inflict suffering in death upon people who in all likelihood never directly wronged him, and even if they did, were only responding to him in a manner determined by their nature? Clearly this is only one last attempt at satisfying himself, and accomplishes nothing more than inflicting more misery. 

Ultimately there isn't much of a divide between the murderer, the grieving father, the ethical foundation of the judicial system, and the incel who went ER. All of them are a fine example human cruelty, it's just that some are a bit more honest and upfront about it than others.

TL;DR: All forms of punishment, for the sake of retribution alone, are only carried out to satisfy someone's sadism, upon whom they believe responsibly rests. There is no fundamental difference between a person being overcome by an outburst of rage, an individual carrying out an attack upon their society in a final act of revenge, and a judge/jury condemning one of the two former examples to decades of imprisonment for the sake of punishment alone. Each one is an emotional, unemphatic, and illogical response to a difficult situation, and none of them accomplish anything worthwhile. The only difference is that one is endorsed by a society or government, while the others are not."
"Understanding total looks, Face vs Height - Why both manlets and ugly tallfags can exist simultaneously",Serious,Gymcelled,"Feb 15, 2021",15000,90,"This will probably be my most autistic post yet but i think it's seriously needed.

tl;dr this post will mathematically explain to you how hard it is to compensate for a singular atrocious flaw
It's possible for both manlets and ugly tallfags to exist simultaneously because being extremely bad at one of the two features (face or height) will induce a larger penalty on your looks score
Don't think in simple arithmetic averages 

The point isn't to discuss which one is more important but rather how they interact with each other


The manlet vs ugly tallfag conundrum 
This is perhaps the biggest point of contention on this forum.

On one hand you have really short guys with decent faces looking at their life experiences and concluding that face is NOT more important than height, because it hasn't saved them. Ugly tallfags do the same with their height. Each member of the two camps is convinced that the other one is full of bullshit.

People often say that height is the ""looks multiplier"". I disagree, I think it's more complicated than that.

I will attempt to explain how EVEN IF face and height have the EXACT SAME worth, we can still prove with simple mathematics that it's possible to fail to compensate with the other feature.

Hypothesis 1: Face and height have the exact same worth (50/50). 

(we're trying to simplify the calculations, if you disagree: keep in mind this equality only strengthens what i'm about to show)

Hypothesis 2: No other factor come into play when it comes to your looks score. (again we're doing this to simply the examples)

At the end I show you that this still works even if you attribute a different worth to face and height, and you're free to expand the model by adding in more variables.

First a quick analogy to explain what this post is about


20lbs smartphone analogy, why linear arithmetic thinking is wrong

Imagine there’s a smartphone that comes out and has to be rated. It’s amazing at everything: fast, great battery, amazing software, good camera, nice speakers, looks aesthetic … but it weighs 20lbs (or 10kg). Would anyone want that phone? Being so bad at that one singular thing ruins everything and makes it worthless as a phone. Yet if you were to rate all of its feature, add all the ratings up and average it, it would look like an amazing phone right?
Averaging things with a simple arithmetic mean is not always relevant.

If you're extremely short OR extremely ugly but you're amazing in every other area of life ... YOU'RE THE 20LBS PHONE, YOU'RE A FAILED PRODUCT THAT NO ONE WANTS


Using other means to evaluate looks 

The arithmetic mean doesn’t care about the variance (spread) of your data. It doesn’t take into account how a god awful feature might ruin everything.

The geometric and the harmonic mean are better suited for rating looks because they impose a penalty based on the spread of the face and height scores. If you’re really bad at either face or height it’ll take that into account and compensating with the other will be much harder.

The formulas for geometric and harmonic means are given below










By only taking into account face and height and by attributing the same worth (ie we assume that face and height are equally as important), the formulas simply become sqrt(f*h) and (2*f*h)/(f+h) for the geometric and the harmonic mean respectively (where f and h are the face and height scores, from 0 to 10).

As you can see below, I make face go from 0 to 5 and height from 10 to 5. This would be an ugly guy trying to compensate with height. If we simply apply the arithmetic mean we get 5/10 in looks regardless of the combination. As if being a 4 and 6/10 in face and height is the same as a 1 and 9/10.

Meanwhile, the geometric and harmonic mean will impose a penalty on the total looks score when either face or height gets very low. So a guy with a REALLY BAD face will still have a bad looks score, just like a turbomanlet would if he tried to compensate with face.

Personally I prefer the harmonic mean because it’s stricter than the geometric mean. As you can see, someone who scores a 2 and 8/10 in face and height (or the reverse case) will only be a 3/10 (3.2 to be exact).








This is how you mathematically explain both turbomanlets AND ugly tallfags being a thing. Even if face and height were equally as strong you wouldn’t be able to compensate perfectly with the other one simply because of the 20lbs smartphone effect. Your flaw is just too big to be ignored, it ruins everything.

With that we can generate curves for different height scores and make face vary.

So with H=2 for instance (turbomanlet) you can see that increases in face barely help the shortcel at all.





Same graph but with less curves and zoomed in to show.





One more example comparing arithmetic and harmonic mean with height = 7/10 and a varying face.






What if face and height don't have the same worth? (Face > Height or Face < Height)

So let’s say you disagree with face and height being 50/50. You think one or the other is more important. Let’s say 60/40 or 30/70 for instance. This model still works, you just have to apply the formula below.

You can also add more variables (race, frame, whatever).





I did some quick curves with 60/40 and 70/30. You can investigate further if you're curious. If you think the spreading penalty is too big just use the geometric mean instead and apply weights to the formula.






DISCLAIMER
Am I saying that looks are EXACTLY determined by the harmonic mean? No I’m just using that as an example to explain what happens when your face or height are really bad, it's for the sake of penalizing really bad scores in either face or height. Obviously I’m not autistic enough to believe that it works specifically with that mean. It’s more of a way to visualize and understand what is happening.

Lastly I think this penalty I talked about only starts kicking below 5/10 and only becomes significant below 4/10. If someone were to score above 5/10 in both face and height then forget the harmonic mean, the arithmetic mean should be more accurate because you don't have that big failo and ""ew 20lbs phone"" effect.

"Racepill Part 3 (ethnics, enter at your own risk)",Blackpill,13k,"Apr 27, 2018",21000,71,"Today's blackpill thread will be about ""Mate Selection in Cyberspace: The Intersection of Race, Gender and Education"" 

It is based on results from the study, from Ken-Hou Lin of The University of Texas and Jennifer Lundquist of U. Mass Amherst, published in The American Journal of Sociology. The study finds that significant racial preferences exist regardless of education status. 

I've skimmed through the study for you guys and now I will be sharing simple takeaways for the lazycels who don't wanna read it all. The study looked at a large dataset from one of the most popular dating sites of more than 9 million users who sent more than 200 million messages from November 2003 to 2010.

Takeaways:

1- The likelihood someone will send an initial message to a person of their own and other races, regardless of other factors like socioeconomic status and body type. A darker panel reflects a higher likelihood of contact:





As you all already know, white men are getting MOST messages from ALL races except black women. And now lets look at what are odds for responding;

2- Predicted odds of responding to an initial message based on race





This one also should be already known by everybody since literally every single experiment and data shows same. Women of ALL RACES are responding to white senders at heightest ratio. And similarly Men of all races respond to white and asian women at highest ratio.

3-EDUCATION
this is the part of the study that, I personally believe, sets the study apart from other online dating experients. It also includes EDUCATION into the equation. Now lets see if normslimes ""muh education and being self-rounded person"" meme have any validity to it: 

""One of the most fascinating findings is that for white daters, education status plays essentially no role in changing racial preference, as the below chart of the likelihood of response shows""



 

White men and women with a college degree, are more likely to respond to white daters without a college degree than to black daters who have a degree.

4-ASIAN FEMALE / WHITE MALE COUPLES EXPLAINED

""people often assume the relative prevalence of white male/Asian woman couples come from white men's apparent preference for stereotypically submissive women. It turns out they show no such preference, and that it's Asian women who tend to be relatively more receptive to white men.""

White men dont necessarily have a ""yellow-fever"". it is the noodlewhores that worship white dick. 

5- You can't take foids' statments at their face value

""In addition to emphasizing the degree to which race affects how we partner up online, it also adds some interesting new wisdom. For example, racial boundaries tend to be more important when people search, and less important when people respond.""

Study finds out even people who say ""race doesnt matter"" hate ethnics with a BURNING PASSION.

""When attracted to other groups, only some daters are welcomed to cross the borders. In this sense, racial boundaries function similarly to one-way turnstile gates. While non-black daters, particularly white men, are well received when they contact daters of other groups, black daters, particularly black women, are largely confined to a segregated dating market.""

If you're short you can't even be a sperm donor,Blackpill,Robinxyz,"Mar 4, 2018",22000,62,"I was looking for info on how to be a donor and this is what I've found: 

Apply only if you're at least average height. addition to age, there are height restrictions of who can donate sperm in the U.S. and many other countries. Shorter men don't have more issues with their sperm compared to tall men, but the recipients of the sperm almost always request taller donors, so the sperm banks and fertility clinic comply with their wishes.

Short height is often a function of genetics, although environmental factors (poor nutrition as a child, infections, exposure to toxins) can play a significant role also.
Taller children tend to fit in better among their peers (assuming they're not giants) and eventually have a higher probability of success with dating, marriage and mating.

The Impact of Facial Aesthetic and Reconstructive Surgeries on Patients’ Quality of Life (TL;DR Warning),Based,Sparrow's Song,"Sep 20, 2019",9000,9,"Don't let normies tell you that your appearance is not the source of your depression, that facial surgery won't help you at all, and it should not be covered. There are many studies online that prove that facial surgery can significantly improve your life. Here are the results of a study published in 2014, one that I am sure many of you are familiar with.




The aim of the present prospective and descriptive study was to assess the impact of facial aesthetic and reconstructive surgeries on quality of life. Ninety-one patients, of whom 43 had aesthetic surgery and 48 had reconstructive surgery, were analysed. The data were collected using the patient information form, body cathexis scale, and short form (SF)-36 quality of life scale. There were significant differences between before and after the surgery in both groups in terms of body cathexis scale and quality of life (p < 0.05 for both). It was observed that problems regarding the body image perception were encountered more, and the quality of life was poorer in both aesthetic and reconstructive surgery patients before the surgery. However, the problems were decreased, and the quality of life was enhanced after the surgery. Among the parameters of SF-36 quality of life scale, particularly the mean scores of social functioning, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, mental health, and vitality/fatigue were found low before the surgery, whereas the mean scores were significantly improved after the surgery. The results revealed that facial aesthetic and reconstructive surgical interventions favourably affected the body image perception and self-esteem and that positive reflections in emotional, social, and mental aspects were effective in enhancing self-confidence and quality of life of the individual.


Beauty and its social reflections have remained on the agenda of the populations from past to present and succeeded to stay on the top [1]. Physical appearance is quite effective on the lives of many people. For this reason, any change in body image perception may cause social losses, such as job, status, and role losses, along with the loss in beauty and attractiveness. Body image perception is a picture of the body and all body-related senses in mind. When an individual has any deformity in his/her appearance or any dysfunction, he/she experiences an inner conflict between the perceived body image at that moment and the image envisioned. Thought processes, performance, and self-concept response of the individual are changed, and self-confidence is lost along with the change in the body image perception. Thus, it is important to improve body image perception and deformity and dysfunction of the body in shaping the body image perception and self-esteem. The surgical treatment enhances self-confidence of the individual and influences the quality of life.

The face has a symbolic importance in public and personal relationships and is a window of an individual to the world. In this regard, any dysfunction or deformity in the face unfavourably influences the appearance and psychology of the individual and leads to aesthetic concern. Facial interventions in plastic, aesthetic, and reconstructive surgery are the procedures in which aesthetic concern is high, particularly due to their impact on appearance.

The aim of our study was to investigate whether facial aesthetic and reconstructive surgeries, which are important at first sight, affect the quality of life and to determine whether there are differences between patients who underwent aesthetic or reconstructive surgery in terms of gender, socioeconomic status, and education.


The study population comprised 108 cases admitted to the Plastic, Reconstructive, and Aesthetic Surgery Clinic of the Marmara University Hospital between March 2008 and August 2008 for facial aesthetic and reconstructive surgical interventions. After 6 months of follow-up period, 84 % (n = 91) of the patients who were able to be reached constituted the study sample; of the patients, 43 had undergone aesthetic surgery and 48 had undergone reconstructive surgery.
After obtaining the ethics committee and the hospital approvals, the patients were informed about the objective of the study. The study was initiated after obtaining the written informed consents of the patients.
The study was conducted using the patient information form to assess the demographic characteristics of the cases as well as the reasons of need for aesthetic and reconstructive surgical intervention, the body cathexis scale (BCS) to assess the level of body image satisfaction, and the short form (SF)-36 quality of life scale for general health inquiry. The questionnaires were applied both before the surgery (just after the admission) and 3 months after the surgery.
Data were analysed using the Stata: Data Analysis and Statistical Software version 9.0 (Stata Corporation LP, TX, USA). A p value of <0.05 was considered significant.


Logistic regression model, which was performed for multivariable analysis of the cases that underwent aesthetic surgical intervention as compared with the cases that underwent reconstructive surgical intervention, revealed that the ratio of female patients was five times higher, the ratio of university graduates was 4.5 times higher, and the ratio of those with high economic level was 15.6 times higher in the aesthetic surgery group as compared with those in the reconstructive surgery group.








When the groups were evaluated in terms of the reasons for undergoing aesthetic and reconstructive surgeries, 74 % (n = 32) of the patients undergoing aesthetic surgery and 84 % (n = 40) of the patients undergoing reconstructive surgery responded as ‘being uncomfortable with my physical appearance’. Among the patients responding as ‘other’, three patients responded as ‘my self-confidence is enhanced’, one patient responded as ‘at the insistence of my relatives’ in the aesthetic surgery group and two patients undergoing reconstructive surgery responded as ‘to look more beautiful to my spouse’.







The mean BCS scores before and after the surgery were 153.44 ± 15.36 and 166.81 ± 16.91, respectively, in the aesthetic surgery group, whereas it was 148.48 ± 18.54 and 168.38 ± 13.59, respectively, in the reconstructive surgery group. There was a significant difference between the BCS scores before and after the surgery both in the aesthetic and reconstructive surgery patients (p < 0.001 for both). However, no significant difference was obtained between the aesthetic and reconstructive surgery patients in terms of the mean BCS scores before and after the surgery before intervention (t = −1.38, p = 0.17) and after intervention.







With regard to the distribution and comparison of the mean SF-36 quality of life scale scores among aesthetic and reconstructive surgery patients before and after the intervention, ‘emotional role functioning’ was found to be affected much more negatively in the reconstructive surgery patients as compared with that of the aesthetic surgery patients. While the mean emotional role functioning score of the aesthetic surgery patients was 44.96 ± 43.57 before the surgery, it was 11.81 ± 27.06 in the reconstructive surgery patients; the difference was statistically significant.

My thoughts:

Notice that there were five times as many foids as men in this study. Foids already have a higher quality of life simply do to the fact that they were born on tutorial island.

Well over half of these surgeries were not covered by insurance, that means most of the people studied were rich and would have higher qualities of life than people who were just as ugly as them and poor as well.

Imagine if a similar study was done for poor incels and all the surgeries were covered by healthcare. The change in their quality of life would be even more significant than the significant changes observed in the above study. Most poor incels would cry on the floor as if Jesus himself came and cured their ugliness if their surgeries were covered. The improvements would be so great it would change the way that normies think about male facial surgery if the news did a segment about the study.


[TL;DR]
Obviously, facial surgery makes your life exponentially better if you're ugly. Our problems in life are basically how ugly we are and the fact that we are too poor to afford the surgeries needed to prevent truicide. Any doctor who isn't a cuck knows this."
Masculinity IS fragile.,Serious,soymonkcel,"Nov 21, 2020",22000,98,"TL/DR: read text in green.

To be socially (and sexually) acceptable as cis hetero guys, we have to present ourselves to others fitting into a narrow set of traits, like never showing weakness, being hyperagents (a.k.a. being confident) in most situations, having looks that are barely under our performative control (having reached certain height, good physiognomy, not being bald, having a correct frame... except, to some extent, having an athletic physique if your genes aren't against you), etc.

Why do we act the way we act as men? Some will say P A T R I A R C H Y®: it’s because we learn it from other men, whether it is from our fathers, our friends, media, etc. We do learn it from them indeed, it's not merely biological. But why do the people we learn those things from behave like that to begin with? Because their main goal is getting laid. In other words: the code of conduct called “masculinity” should not be broken, under penalty of being disliked by women (or society in general, which is a way of pursuing female validation indirectly). The problem is that it is really hard to not break such code, hence, it’s fragile.

Think about gays. Why are a good deal of them openly less “masculine” (or more feminine) in some traits? Because such behavior isn’t accompanied by sexual withdrawal from the sex they are interested in: other gay men. They will still have plenty of people to have intimacy with.

Some (technically homophobic?) hetero cis men ask themselves or others if doing or saying X, Y, Z is gay (not masculine). Does it make a bit more sense now? And before any lurkers/bluepillers get outraged: no, I never say such things myself nor I have any problem with gay folks.

Hetero cis men, by definition, want the sexual approval of women. For that, they have to fit into women’s standards, so they have to act a certain way. So women/feminists laugh at fragile masculinity because they think it comes from us, but it comes from women’s standards. When they signal or laugh at how fragile masculinity is, they are actually signaling/laughing at how hard to attain their own standards/expectations are.

Masculinity is fragile for heterosexual guys because women’s standards are fragile. Don’t let them dehumanize us with their fragile idea of what masculinity should be.

And this message isn’t only for you, gentlemen. This goes for every heterosexual cis guy out there."
[STUDY] Chick magnets commit more sexual assault and intimate partner violence. Misogynistic men have far more sex partners and one night stands,JFL,Edmund_Kemper,"Feb 9, 2021",14000,134,"https://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC4842162&blobtype=pdf



Holy shit i actually cannot believe this   

In a sample of 555 men ages 18-25 (mean age is 20.6 and the standard deviation is 2.1), they found that misogynistic men have far more sex partners, more one night stands, and are more likely to beat their partner or commit sexual assault. This just shows that chick magnets commit more sexual assault and beat their partners more than average men. They're also way more likely to be in a fraternity (58% were in a fraternity).

Here's a quote:

""The third latent class group, a relatively small proportion of the sample (8 %), had high endorsement of rigidly traditional notions of masculinity and high hostility toward women. They also reported committing far more physical IPV, control IPV, and sexual assault than any other group and, for these reasons, we characterized this group’s masculinity as Misogynistic. Sexual sensation seeking levels were high in this group. Misogynistic men reported the highest support for a traditionally masculine sexual script and the lowest support for the monogamy and emotion script of any men in the sample. These men’s mean numbers of both lifetime sexual partners and lifetime one-night stands were higher than those of men in the two Normative groups, and they were more likely than men in any other group to have paid for sexual services. Many of them were also daily pornography users (although frequent use of pornography was common across this sample). Regarding male group involvement, Misogynistic men participated in organized sports teams, informal sports, and computer or gaming groups at higher levels than men in most other groups, and their fraternity membership proportion (58 %) was the highest of any group.""

This is supported by another study i found about how sexually active teenage boys are more misogynistic."
"Virgin shaming causes way more rape, sexual assault and rape culture than slut shaming",Venting,Edmund_Kemper,"Feb 4, 2021",15000,100,"All the feminists on the planet say that slut shaming causes rape and that it is part of rape culture. Well, guess what? Virgin shaming is a MUCH MUCH bigger cause of rape than slut shaming.

Admittedly, its extremely rare for rapists to be virgins or sexually inexperienced. In fact, studies have consistently shown that rapists are often far more sexually successful than most men. Rapists do often have consensual sex, far more often than they rape. They tend to have consensual sex far more often than most men and have way more sex partners and more dating partners than most men. They also lose their virginity early and have a first date at an early age. Rapists who never had consensual sex/relationships are in fact extremely rare. They don't even really exist. Aside from having far more girlfriends, far more sex partners, and being promiscuous chick magnet chads, rapists tend to be involved in subcultures that have a lot of chads, such as athletics and fraternities. College athletes and college men who played aggressive sports in HS are more likely to rape and frat boys also are much more likely to rape. (Sorority girls are more likely to be rape victims than non-sorority college girls).

What causes rapists to commit rape? Pressure to have lots of sex. That's a common motive among rapists. The idea it's about power is mostly a myth. Perceived pressure to have sex is a big cause of men committing rape and it's a common motive among rapists. David Lisak, an expert on rapists, wrote:

""'Undetected rapists' have consistently been shown to more sexually active than other men. Apart from their sexually aggressive behavior, they engage in consensual and coercive sex far more often than is typical for men of their age group. Their sexual activity tends to be an important component of their identities. Thus, rather than being a product of a greater sex drive, their increased sexual activity appears to be driven by their view that if they are not very active then they are neither 'successful' nor adequate as men.""

He also writes: ""A consistent finding in the recent research on 'undetected' sexually violent men is that most of this violence emerges either directly or indirectly from what have been termed 'sexually violent subcultures.' Examples of such subcultures include fraternities and delinquent gangs. These subcultures are powerful forces that both reflect the rapist's views about women and sexual conquest, and also help to shape them. For example, at certain college fraternities, the use of violent pornography is a frequent form of 'entertainment,' providing explicit images of rape as being acceptable, noncriminal, and the sign of male virility. Within these subcultures, 'sexual conquests' - having sex with as many women as possible - becomes a critical measure of how men view themselves and each other. The greater number of such conquests, the more manly he is viewed. The use of coercion and violence to secure these conquests is normalized in the subculture and becomes simply another part of the man's 'sexual arsenal.'""

Obviously you can see here that although virgin shaming doesn't directly cause rape (they aren't encouraging virgins in particular to rape), it indirectly does. Virgin shaming leads to men thinking they need to have as much sex as possible and as many sex partners as possible, which leads to rape. Virgin shaming is the first stage and rape is the third.

"[HIGH IQ] The Term 'Involuntary celibate' was not created by a Foid named ""Alana""!",LifeFuel,Benj-amin,"Jan 20, 2021",8000,38,"All it takes is a simple Google Search of the term ""Involuntary Celibates"" (With Quotes.), in the Google Books section, Sort by Date, and click ""19th Century"" instead of ""Any Time"", this is what you will find.


""Involuntary celibate"" - Google zoeken








The term ""Involuntary celibate"" dates all the way back the the 19th Century in two books, one was the Cambridge essays, published in 1858! The term was used verbatim, Were men in tenure were bound to be Involuntary celibate until their tenure was over. There is no way for this ""Alana"" to have coined this term in 1858, for she would have to be over 162 Years of age in 2021! Clearly this is not possible. For no man, or woman, has ever reached such an age, and would inevitable garner media attention on this fact alone, seeing as she has not, she clearly wasn't in this time period.

This term then got a second revival in Henry Flynt's ""Blueprint for civilization, which was published in 1975, where he Flynt described Verbatim Involuntary celibacy:
"" The creep is an involuntary celibate because he fails to develop the surface traits of adulthood--poise and sophistication; and because he is shy, unassertive, and lacks self-confidence in the presence of others . The creep is awkward and has an unstylish appearance. He seems sexless and childish. He is regarded by the ideal adults with condescending scorn, amusement, or pity.""

I also have evidence to come to the conclusion that this ""Alana"" is not even what she claims to be, there is no evidence that she is even a woman, there is no photos of her, no Articles on google scholar about her ""Group"" or any of her Research, and she clearly was not even the one responsible for coining the term ""Involuntary Celibacy"". For all I know, I might as well effectively say that she does not exist.
This is Lifefuel for all the Incels who were lied to about the term ""Involuntary CElibate"" being ""Coined"" by some Neoliberalism Feminist out of some university,"

[THEORY] The Genetic Lottery Pill | Chads are Made By Chance,Blackpill,Selinity,"Jan 3, 2021",10000,41,"*This post will take three minutes to read, but if you're lazy the bare-bone minimum to understand are highlighted in green

Hypothesis: We all had a chance at being Chad's. That's the truth. You can all it a cope if you want, but it's true. Our genes always had the potential to be attractive and sought after. Let me explain.

When a mother and a father conceive a child that child is formed of 46 chromosomes, or 23 from each parent. These chromosomes are what makes up your genes, effecting your behaviour, blood type and genetics. But we all know this, this probably isn't anything new to you. But what you may not have known is that each gene or chromosome comes with multiple variants of the same traits. one chromosome can be expressed in multiple different forms, for example, your blood type can be A, AB, B or O and many times is something that neither of your parents have.

This is called Gene Expression.

*Gene expression is the process by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional gene product that enable to produce protein as the end product. These products are often proteins, but in non-protein-coding genes such as transfer RNA or small nuclear RNA genes, the product is a functional RNA.

But some genes do not end up expressed even if you have the chromosomes required for it. This is how deadly diseases such as cancer can be unknowingly transferred through a blood-line for years before actually becoming active in a person.





But this isn't all, there also exists something called genetic variation,Genetic variation refers to diversity in gene frequencies. Genetic variation can refer to differences between individuals or to differences between populations. Mutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation, but mechanisms such as sexual reproduction and genetic drift contribute to it as well.





 


Genetic Variation, Gene Expression, Recombination as well as meiosis all contribute towards this randomization of trait combinations and possible proteins and features your genetics can express.

*Meiosis is a special type of cell division of germ cells in sexually-reproducing organisms used to produce the gametes, such as sperm or egg cells. It involves two rounds of division that ultimately result in four cells with only one copy of each paternal and maternal chromosome. Meiosis produces four haploid (n) gametes that are genetically unique from each other and the original parent (germ) cell.






Even without this however there's already 8,324,608 possible combination for chromosomes.







And you weren't the only one who had 8 million possible variations of their genes, every single (non Autistic) person had a one in 8 million chance of looking how they do. In one of these 8 million you had the chance to be significantly more attractive. Maybe your genes for a negative canthal tilt are turned off and not expressed in one of these 8 million, maybe you don't have messed up teeth, maybe you have and extra inch or two on your height, maybe you have higher testosterone levels and more sexually day-orphic features in one of these realities. 

If you have a sibling is your sibling more attractive than you? Do you mog them? Chad's, or good looking people are simply those who got the best out of their 8 million combinations and mutations. 

*This means that there are a few combinations that would produce the most attractive facial aesthetic, and one that would allow you to have easiest access to sex and resources.

These are the Odds of The Genetic Lottery, 1 in 8 Million.

The one in 8 million chance that you turned out how you did.

"Women's brain structure resembles that of pathological liars (3 studies, neuroscience)",Blackpill,Gymcelled,"Nov 23, 2020",17000,67,"Study 1: Prefrontal white matter in pathological liars 

""Results:  Liars showed a 22-26% increase in prefrontal white matter and a 36-42% reduction in prefrontal grey/white ratios compared with both antisocial controls and normal controls.""

More white matter in the prefrontal lobe = more inclined to lie and manipulate people
Another group of researchers followed up on this same study 2 years later and found similar results

Study 2: Localisation of increased prefrontal white matter in pathological liars


""Liars showed a relatively widespread increase in white matter (23–36%) in orbitofrontal, middle and inferior, but not superior, frontal gyri compared with antisocial and normal controls. This white matter increase may predispose some individuals to pathological lying. ""

Why does this matter? Well based on another study, women have noticeably more prefrontal white matter than men, making them more prone to lying pathologically


Study 3: The neuroanatomy of general intelligence: Sex matters

""Compared to men, women show more white matter and fewer gray matter areas related to intelligence. In men IQ/gray matter correlations are strongest in frontal and parietal lobes (BA 8, 9, 39, 40), whereas the strongest correlations in women are in the frontal lobe (BA10) along with Broca's area. Men and women apparently achieve similar IQ results with different brain regions, suggesting that there is no singular underlying neuroanatomical structure to general intelligence and that different types of brain designs may manifest equivalent intellectual performance. ""

Women have more white matter in the frontal lobe, while men have more grey matter there. Here's a picture below from that same study to help you viusalize it
Worse yet: 86% of women's white matter dedicated to intelligence is located IN THE FRONTAL LOBES, compared to 0% (ZERO) for men

""Even greater sex differences were observed in WM (white matter), where for women 86% of the identified voxels were frontal, as compared to 0% in men.""







Conclusions? 

Women are much more inclined to lie because of the very structure of their brain. For them thinking and manipulating are closely related because so much of their brain power is involved in deceit

A question worth raising is: Are you born with this or is this a product of behavior? Well according to study 2 it can be both.

"" One interpretation of the white matter increases in the ventral and lateral non-superior frontal regions could be that a pre-existing variation in prefrontal structure may predispose individuals to engage in pathological lying. Alternatively, several studies have argued that long-term training may induce regional increases in white matter volume (Schmithorst & Wilke, 2002; Bengtsson et al, 2005). In the case of lying, it is conceivable that excessive lying repeatedly activates the prefrontal circuit underlying lying, resulting in permanent changes in brain morphology. This 'Pinocchio's nose' hypothesis of pathological lying could be compared with the competing predispositional hypothesis using a prospective longitudinal study assessing both white matter volume and degree of lying from childhood to adulthood. ""

Some people are born liars. But lying constantly can rewire and rebuild your brain to make you naturally even more prone to lying ...

"""Who would destroy the world? Omnicidal agents and related phenomena""",Discussion,Deleted member 8353,"Oct 11, 2019",6000,12,"Not sure if this belongs in inceldom discussion or offtopic as it does mention ER, Cho, and others, however this is largely secondary to the point I want to make. Anyway this article seems pretty ironic to me, as it talks about ""misguided moral actors"", despite the author being an example of exactly that, at least as far as I'm concerned.

In our modern age new technologies are able to generate and channel mass empowerment, allowing small groups and individuals to challenge states and other institutions of traditional authority in ways that used to be the province only of other states. 

Consider a few short descriptions of agent subtypes motivated by consequentialist ethical theories. Unlike the other subsections above and below, this discussion is somewhat abstract given that few individuals have openly acknowledged a moral desire to annihilate humanity if doing so were possible, even though this prescription follows directly from certain moral commitments associated with forms of classical utilitarianism and negative utilitarianism. 

(ii)Radical negative utilitarians(NUs). As Thaddeus Metz (2012)puts it, radical NUs accept the ethical theory of antinatalism as well as pro-mortalism, the view that it is often prudent for individuals to kill themselves and often right for them to kill others, even without their consent. It pretty clearly has these implications if one can kill oneself or others painlessly, but probably does so even if there would be terror beforehand; for there would be terror regardless of when death comes, and if death were to come sooner rather than later, then additional bads that would have been expected in the course of a life would be nipped in the bud.

So perhaps I've been missing something all along, but how exactly is negative utilitarianism misguided? The fact that it's not emotionally palatable for most people isn't an argument, and you can't use individual consent when the vast majority of humans don't respect this themselves(birth, mutilation of children, child rearing, indoctrination, opposition to suicide, etc), aside from in very specific and ultimately arbitrary contexts (female sexual selection), thereby breaking their own rules.

Secondly what the writer of the above paragraph doesn't seem to get is that while this scenario of ethical killing might make sense conceptually, it very rarely works out that way in reality, perhaps an exception would be the red button scenario, or two people on a hypothetical island. Beyond that you're almost certainly going to cause more suffering that you'd prevent, because the death of a person hurts everyone around them, even if we accept that death isn't a bad thing in and of itself. Not to mention that a particularly bad manner of death might well be worse for some people than letting them experience all other forms pain which await them preceding their natural death. Just because I can prove that pleasure is observably distinct from, and ultimately enslaved to suffering, this doesn't mean that there is a way to measure suffering which isn't entirely subjective. Meaning that while we can say pain/discomfort/suffering is bad, there is no intuitive way for me to discern the true level of suffering experienced by someone outside myself, I can only say for certain that it's something to be avoided, and that it can't be justified by it's intrinsic relationship to existence.

As for the argument that this reasoning suggests that we should commit suicide, well that part is mostly true. However as I was getting at before, your death would likely hurt others, making it less clear whether or not it's truly the right decisions in most contexts. Furthermore this point is largely irrelevant, as most people are incapable of killing themselves at all, and many others would find themselves unable to do so without help. So suggesting that suicide is within the best interest of everyone isn't useful if the vast majority of us lack the capacity to kill ourselves.

TL;DR Those are just some of my thoughts, but what do you think about this article? Personally I find it funny that the author imagines a doomsday device in the hands of ER, as he had trouble overcoming a door."

Brainlets to Framecels; How the contrasting imperatives between natural selection and sexual selection may have helped create incels.,Blackpill,ColdLightOfDay,"Dec 22, 2018",8000,22,"There are two main processes by which evolution can take place;

Natural Selection; which is defined as differential potential for survival based upon genetic traits and the practical advantages they provide the subject over other animals and members of their own species within their natural habitat.

Sexual Selection; which is defined as the process by which certain genetic traits become exemplified over time because of the their influence on mate selection due to their appeal to the opposite sex.
- example; it is theorised that the reason that humans have larger penises than the great-apes is because human females understood the relationship between a larger penis and increased pleasure during sex, and so selected males with larger penises, slowly breeding out lesser endowed males to the point where the average penis size of a human male increased over time. (I will likely be making another thread on this in the near future).

Because the great apes are our closest living relatives, it is useful to use them as a reference point when mapping out the evolution of various human traits since some point around 6-8 million years ago, when chimpanzees and humans shared their last known common ancestor, known as CHLCA. It is theorised that CHLCA was equipped with much greater physical strength and bone density than a modern homo-sapien because not only are the great apes on average 2-3 times stronger than a man, but also early man, from homo-erectus to homo-neanderthalensis exhibited greater physical strength and bone density than modern man, so weaker frame and muscle mass are a trait specific to modern humans within the greater hominid family tree.

The only way to explain this natural recession in a uniformly advantageous evolutionary trait such as physical strength is the rise of another trait with even higher evolutionary value, which would demand a larger share of energy metabolised by the body and a change in the emphasis of its allocation away from the muscles involved with physical strength. Incase you haven't guessed it, this trait is intelligence, and it is what sets human beings apart from the other great apes as evolutionary compensation for the weakening of our physical stature. A human brain (despite only making up 2% of our body mass) consumes roughly 25% of our energy consumption, double the percentage required by a chimpanzee brain.

This trade-off between physical prowess and mental acuity can be effectively summarised in incel terminology as a transition from brainlet to framecel, as all great apes are effectively brainlets in comparison to humans despite the fact they framemog us into oblivion.

interestingly, for those of you who buy into the bell curve displaying variation in IQ scores between the races (generally accepted as Asian > White > Black) the trade-off between intelligence and physical strength/athletic ability is also evident along this continuum, as where one race may supersede others with regard to mental acuity, this advantage comes at the price of a decrease in their physical prowess, with the exception of South Asians who are outliers in this respect (sorry curries, I do not know why nature can be so cruel).

The reason this trade-off is interesting is because it is clear to me, as it should be to all of those who are blackpilled, that perceived physical prowess is a far, far more advantageous evolutionary trait when it comes to sexual selection than intelligence. Yes, it is theorised that the reason women are more attracted to funny men than unfunny ones is because the ability to make people laugh is often indicative of high-intelligence, but we blackpilled all know that having a naturally powerful body increases your likelihood for sexual selection by females to a much greater degree than being funny or smart does.

So why has evolution sacrificed our physical strength for intelligence when being strong would actually be more advantageous in helping us find a mate and spread our genes? My new theory states that it is because; millennia ago in a more brutal and harsher world, settlements of smarter men outbred those of stronger men due to their heightened ability to control their environment and extend their lives, this process is evident in the quick extinction of Neanderthals from Europe in the proceeding millennia after the arrival of Homo sapiens in the area. This shows us that natural selection, particularly back then, favoured intelligence over strength - however - sexual selection on the part of women has always favoured strength over intelligence, and thus after the base level of higher intelligence in the successful Homo sapien settlements was established, a process of sexual selection began, breeding out the physically weaker males thus slowly increasing the average strength of all males in the same way the smaller penis males were selectively bred into recession to be replaced by generations with on average larger penises. Due to the rapid spread of intelligent human activity across the world, both these processes have not yet been carried out to completion, which is why we see such dichotomy in male body types across and within human populations, and why framecels and dickcels who are the end of their evolutionary line are still being born today."

It is as I have always thought: personality means shit. I have been rejected by women all my life despite of being a good person. I have been also rejected by my extended family because of my looks. I have always been an outcast. There was a time in my life when I was an avid reader of self help books. I thought I was at fault for not being liked. So, I began to be more social and open to others but that led me nowhere. The rejections still kept coming. And I got quite a few backstabbings along the way. I am so broken and tired. I just want my eternal rest at this time. People like me weren't made for this world, maybe it is the way my brain has been wired. This crap isn't for me. I want out."

Here's the reality about dating and relationships that I rarely see discussed in a direct manner

YOU ARE EITHER ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH TO KEEP A WOMAN ""EXCITED"" JUST BY BEING AROUND HER, OR YOU HAVE TO BECOME HER FUCKING PET JESTER TO MOTIVATE, TRICK AND/OR GUILT HER INTO TRYING TO BE ATTRACTED TO YOU

That's it, that's the summary of how attraction in dating works, all this PUA fuckery is literally just JESTERMAXXING, its just men employing psychological tactics to trick, motivate or guilt a woman into trying to be attracted to them, it isn't ""natural""

Chad doesn't have to memorize pick up lines, rehearse body language, insult a woman indirectly to lower her guard, etc to gain a woman's attention and attract her, his mere presence alone is enough

That's why I find it so amusing to see all these men who boast about ""having game"", its like boasting about who is the best pet, who can do the best tricks to please their master, WHO'S A GOOD BOY, YOU ARE, YOU ARE (here's a treat, you get a few sessions of medicore sex with some used up holes, she'll put in around 50% of the effort she does when fucking Chad, congrats)

To make it worse, there isn't even any security in your trials anymore, a man can Jestermaxx like a pro, ""win her over"" and have this amazing story of effort to tell his children about ""how he met their mother"", and ironically said children may not even be his (paternity fraud is at new highs these days), or she may have been cheating all along, or even at the current point of that relationship while he's talking to his kids, there's no security even after all the embarrassing, undignified shit you put yourself through, just to gamble for used up pussy

I mean if you had to do all this shit to get a virgin wife it would still be ridiculous, but it would atleast be understandable, but what the average man does to himself for used goods today, will always amuse me, also the remarks of incels who are ""looking for love"" and ""female affection/validation"" 

Game is nothing to take pride in, if you have to use game, its an admission that you simply aren't attractive enough to JUST BE YOURSELF and have women be attracted to you. Its something you do to compensate for your lack of ""natural ability""

Which reminds me of another thread I made:








Intelligence Is Just A Substitute For Capability


I've said this before and i'll say it again, intelligence is nothing but a substitute for actual ability, so even from an evolutionary perspective one being high in intelligence is more of an indicator to females that said individual lacks the physical capability to take or attain what they want...




incels.is





The average man is not in a stable relationships, their relationships are quite unstable, with no security, and that's because the glue that holds the relationship together is a cheap knockoff of the best brand ""physical attraction"", its artificial, its women forcing themselves to be attracted to you, due to social norms and social pressures, while simultaneously having the choice and ability to monkey branch to an upgrade at a moments notice, that's a ridiculous framework for relationships when it comes to sustainability, it just isn't going to work long term"

Bluepill in genre fiction: you get a second chance to woo a girl,Untagged,tulasdanslos,"Oct 8, 2019",6000,14,"Hello and welcome to my new series called ""Bluepill in genre fiction"". Today we're going to start it off with a love story, ""Los amores lunáticos"" by Lorenzo Silva.

Don't worry, you won't see any Spanish here. I'm just using it as an example of the shit taste people have. This novel has had ¡AT LEAST 6 EDITIONS! and I can debunk the realism of the setting in a short forum post.

Okay, so the protagonist Pablo falls in love with two women at once and he's sub 8 so there's a lot of cringe in the middle of the book, but you just need to know that he tries to chat up a girl his age called Vanessa and he fails completely, he gets friendzoned because ""she's moving to Germany"" (aka he's sub 8 and thus not hookup material for the time remaining until she leaves). He gives her some poems (JFL) and I assume the girl feels bad, so she burns him a CD with songs from Korn and Rammstein. Anyway, some years later he logs on a music forum and spots her. They shoot the shit and this is where the redpill PUA tactics come into play:

She asks him if he knows what her nick means and then he asks for her asl instead. This doesn't get him blocked. She replies!
He puts the lyrics of a song from Rammstein and she calls him smart for tweaking the lyrics into the context. WTF?
He says ""I'm from a lonely long night, aching heart"" and it doesn't get him laughed out of the chat
He makes up that he's going out with some friends just so he could do a ""tactical retreat"" JFL
Right after that, she asks him how they could meet again, and instead of giving her a date and time he says he comes to the forum sometimes
Three days later, he logs in again and she PMs him immediately. He ""waited 15 or 20 secs so that she wouldn't get the impression that I messaged her right away""
They exchange pics and she doesn't recognise him because the slayer reports ""I wore totally different clothes and had a different haircut from the one in my high school years"" Yes I'm not making this shit up, someone read this and thought ""this is quality"".

TL;DR this girl that rejected him after 0,00013 seconds (that's how the comparison between Chad and non-Chad happens in the real world) falls in love with him years later because of personality, fashion and a new haircut. The main character never says he got a second puberty nor anything of the sort. He just fashionmaxxed, haircutmaxxed and listened to songs with alternative models of masculinity    

I don't even care about the thread's reception, I'm just writing for the sake of it right now. The next thread is going to contain more bluepill from the book I chose and more vitriol since I was forced to read that one for school."
Posting here made me realize something about historical conflicts,Blackpill,Deleted member 17724,"Oct 31, 2019",6000,14,"I don't know who it was exactly but I remember not too long ago, that someone made a thread where he described inceldom as the first movement/group to unite men of all races, religions and political ideologies. When I was contemplating this recently, I realized something about history: when you come down to it, every single conflict between men in history was caused by the hypergamous nature of women.

For example, nationalism generally arises in a society when women start intermixing with other races and the men of their own race start getting less chances at getting a sexual partner because of it. In National-Socialist Germany, propaganda posters and films depicted the relationships between Jewish men and German women (never the opposite) as evil and they of course had the Nuremberg laws which outlawed marriages between Jews and Germans. So nationalism arises when men lose the monopoly on women of their own race. The main concern among white nationalists in Europe and America as well is the interbreeding between women (again, never men) of their race with men of other races. This is not limited to whites though, there were news articles for example about Middle-Easterners in France who are frustrated with their women marrying/dating black men.

Socialism could be said to arise when lower-class men no longer have the financial opportunity to marry or otherwise gain a sexual partner. The wealthy elite get all the women for themselves. Something similar happened in Islamic countries where polygamy is legal, where the rich elite men married most of the women, leaving the lower class unable to find a partner thus leading them to joining terrorist organizations like Boko Haram.

On the subject of religion, religion's main purpose has in my opinion always been to legitimize the institution of marriage. As we see in the west, women generally don't feel like remaining loyal to their partner in marriage without a faith forcing them to. We see that religious uprisings often happen right after women get more rights and thus get more opportunity to be whores and not give sub-8 men a chance, just look up photos of Iranian women before and after the Islamic revolution.

So basically, all ideologies exist purely for sub-8 men to increase the chance of gaining a sexual partner and all ideological conflicts were essentially a struggle to regain control over women, who naturally lack any form of loyalty for men that aren't Chad. If women were inherently loyal and not hypergamous, many of the major wars of history would not have happened and men of all races and creeds could live together in peace."
Comparing our fellow mammals and humans,Blackpill,Weed,"May 13, 2018",7000,11,"I think most of you know that humans and every animal specie came from one source, one animal. That's the reason we have two eyes and nose between our eyes and mouth. So let's not deny that we're any different than animals especially mammals because we still are controlled by our instincts MUCH MORE than you think, we just don't obviously notice our instincts in action.

EVERY and I shit you not EVERY mammal specie choose their partners over LOOKS. So why would a human by any different from mammals even tho we're mammals ourselves? A normie might say ""well we have IQ, we've got logic therefore we develop 'stronger' personality"", shut the fuck up. Most of our 'logic' is run by our emotions especially the sex market.
http://bigthink.com/experts-corner/...gical-the-neuroscience-behind-decision-making



A few years ago, neuroscientist Antonio Damasio made a groundbreaking discovery. He studied people with damage in the part of the brain where emotions are generated. He found that they seemed normal, except that they were not able to feel emotions. But they all had something peculiar in common: they couldn’t make decisions. They could describe what they should be doing in logical terms, yet they found it very difficult to make even simple decisions, such as what to eat. Many decisions have pros and cons on both sides—shall I have the chicken or the turkey? With no rational way to decide, these test subjects were unable to arrive at a decision.

Here's another study https://people.hss.caltech.edu/~camerer/Ec101/JudgementUncertainty.pdf



In the 1970s, two psychologists proved, once and for all, that humans are not rational creatures. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky discovered “cognitive biases,” showing that that humans systematically make choices that defy clear logic.

Click to expand...


So why do some normies still think that in sexual market women make ""logical"" decisions? No, they make emotional and instinctual decisions for BETTER REPRODUCTION for THEIR OWN OFFSPRING. Why would they want a baby from some 5 inch wristed small skulled with recessed chin to reproduce with when they can get a way better partner to pass on ""better"" genes? It's not like ""oh this guy has a great personality, I will have a baby from him and it's gonna be strong"", no, women want alpha male because ""oh this guy looks so strong, our baby will be so beautiful"".


Now let's do REAL comparision between animals in the wild and humans..

Here's a video of an alpha wolf and beta/omega wolf


It's so obvious who is the dominant male, heck it would be even obvious EVEN without that dominance display. Observe the strength and bones of those two wolfs.
One wolf looks way bigger, ""wider""(fwhr for humans), bigger paws and legs(wrists and frame for humans).
Now would a female wolf reproduce with this beta/omega wolf or alpha? Obviously alpha, every female in that pack wants that Alpha D.. Even if beta tries to do something, alpha instantly puts him down(bullies and femoids in human situation).

Also I would like to mention that the ""fight"" and ""dominance display"" started because of FEMALE. The scent of the wolf rolled on a FEMALE and that alpha male got mad that this beta cunt is trying to do something like being confident and roll scents around.

https://www.quora.com/What-animals-have-appearance-based-preferences-in-mating another proof animals choose over looks



When the male does the choosing, physical features favor size and weaponry. When the female does the choosing, however, extravagant coloring and oversized appendages are the norm. A number of studies on different species indicate that when females choose mates, they nearly always go for brighter, larger, longer, etc.

Click to expand...


""When the male does the choosing, physical features favor size"" - We as males look for a skinny or at least not a landwhale girl to reproduce with
"" When the female does the choosing, however, extravagant coloring and oversized appendages are the norm"" - Females go for LOOKS like coloring




Another is strength of genetics; that is, if an organism is able to divert resources to energetically expensive physical features while remaining healthy, it is a sign of good genetic stock. A third is parasite tolerance - robust designs are indicative of being able to tolerate developmental and environmental stress.

Also it's not MALES that CHOOSE, FEMALES CHOOSE. https://www.shmoop.com/animal-behavior/finding-mate.html



There are two main ways that animals find a mate:

females choose male partners
males compete over access to females


Click to expand...





Intersexual selection is more than just females deciding which guy is the sexiest. Females want their offspring to survive and prosper, so they want to pick a mate with good genes. By selecting a mate, the females are also picking which males get to pass on their genes. The males that get to pass on their genes are ""fittest"" in the sense of genetic fitness; their genes will continue on to the next generation.

So do normies really think FEMALES would CHOOSE US? BETAS? SUBHUMANS? LOL @ THEM


TL;DR Animals are not different than humans, animals choose partners over looks, humans are no different because we're controlled by our instincts and no being most intelligent animal specie on the planet does not help us forget those instincts, even in the sexual market.

You can look up dominance display on youtube https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dominance+display You will see every ""dominant"" animal is larger and looks more alpha obviously, it's not like their personality made them become alphas. Also you can look up how females choose partners in animal kingdom, simply by googling https://www.google.co.uk/search?ei=...1k1j0i67k1j0i20i263k1j0i22i30k1.0.TVGJwNJz198 and you will see that it's ALL ABOUT LOOKS.0

"Study showing: (1) Women lie tremendously about the importance of looks, and (2) It is Looks > Personality > Money for both genders",Blackpill,RageAgainstTDL,"Jul 14, 2018",9000,44,"This study looked at how important each gender rated: Physical Attractiveness, Personality, and Earning Power in a relationship. Then they studied to what degree these traits actually led to success in speed dating. Speed dating is the fairest model to allow personality or earning power to shine, since you have at least 10 minutes to demonstrate how charismatic or successful you are.

Here was their primary result:






On the left, you can see the degree to which men (blue) and women (red) rated the importance of Attractiveness, Personality, and Earning Power. On the right, you can see to what extent any of those characteristics actually led to dating success (where 0 would be no effect, and 1 would be 100% effect).

In this study, both genders underestimated the importance of looks. Men rated looks as second just barely under personality (8.04/10 vs. 8.1/10). On the other hand, women were WAY off. They rated looks as the LEAST important of all (7.18/10) while for them it was by far the most important thing. In fact, it was slightly more important for women than it was for men.

For getting a woman, looks correlated 0.46 with dating success. This means that as a man, your looks will predict at least 46% of your success or failure in a speed date. Personality correlated 0.32 with dating success. So 32% of your results will be attributed to your personality. Lastly, money only correlated 0.16 with success. So only 16% of your results will depend on money.

What does this tell us? A few primary things:

- For both genders, the order of importance is: Looks > Personality > Money. This reinforces the study findings here, which also showed money is comparatively the least important parameter. In this study, money was actually less important to women than it was for men, yet women said they thought it was quite important at the start.

- Women dramatically underestimate how important having a good looking guy is to them. I'm not sure why this is. Women in general tend to lack self awareness and insight compared to men. Perhaps this is just a manifestation of that. Or it is some form of deeply internalized virtue signalling.

As a whole, this provides scientific evidence that women really have no idea what they find important. They were completely wrong on the relative importance of all three attributes studied. One therefore truly cannot trust what a woman says about dating. One must look at her behavior to understand her values. When we do that, we see as always that looks are top of the totem pole. And if you are a man trying to compensate through money, you will have a very steep climb.

Displays of sexual attraction empower females and shame men,Untagged,Deleted member 20659,"Aug 27, 2019",5000,11,"You are watching a movie in a cinema. Consider the following situations:
1) A hot actress appears seminude in a scene and groups of male friends in the audience whisper to each other how hot she is.
2) Chad takes off his shirt in a scene, and the females in the audience note to each other how attractive he is.

My theory is that both situations are bad for males; 1 happens more often, 2 happens more violently, 1 empowers women, 2 shames men, and 2 is increasingly normalized. It seems to make sense when you take hypergamy into account.

I began thinking about this because of something that happened to me, I was watching a movie in earlier this week and there's a scene in which a famous chad actor takes his shirt off. The females went insane, started talking to each other loudly during the movie and some started taking pictures with their cellphones (with flash even), this went on for minutes, the situation did strike me as aggressive and exaggerated. I wouldn't conceive of this happening the other way around, guys interrupting a movie because of a hot actress. I feel ashamed and inadequate when this type of thing happens, and imagine the other guys present in these situations feel similar.

Situations like 1 are common and females are sexualized in media more often than men, but I think the purpose is simply to explore our visually oriented brains to capture our attention, and females don't seem to feel as ashamed when it happens, but actually feel empowered by it because they know they aren't excluded from these displays of male sexual attraction, as males aren't hypergamous - in other words, they know men are capable of being attracted to them in approximately the same degree as they are to the sexualized female in the screen. So whenever men show to be attracted to some hot female like in situation 1, they are simply displaying/training/engaging in their willingness to value, desire and direct attention to female sexually in general, and this is empowering to women (this would explain stuff like ""not watching porn is misogynistic"" or the hatred directed at volcels, in both cases males aren't willing to participate in the sexualization of females and thus in their empowerment). When males are sexualized in media, on the other hand, something different seems to be going on, females seem to use it as an opportunity to assert themselves sexually (this would explain why they do it so loudly, publicly) over males around them, by implictly contrasting them to the hypergamous ideal (chad) they fall short of. In the violence of these moments, in the loud, aggressive, surprising displays of sexual desire from the part of females towards chad, we are reminded that women are physically incapable of being attracted to us, the average or low status guy, at any meaningful, genuine, significant degree.

Also there might be something to be said about how situations such as 2 are becoming increasingly normalized or even institutionalized. For example I've had female teachers say in front of a class how some male actor or famous chad is hot, and have all the female students agree enthusiastically, but if it was the other way around (a male teacher) it would probably sound creepy. Also the mainstream success of books or movies like Fifty Shades of Grey might be an example of this.

TLDR; Females like it when men sexualize other females because it shows that they are subordinated to female sexuality in general, and also use the public sexualization of chads in entertainment or media to shame men as inadequate. Thus any displays of the male attraction to females, or of the female attraction to chads, benefits females and shames men, and these situations are becoming increasingly common and explicit.

Dating apps and Antinatalism,SuicideFuel,SlayerSlayer,"May 5, 2019",5000,2,"I'm sure the majority of incels are antinatalists.

I think the largest question of the philosophy is rooted in whether or not non-existence is really apocalyptic as it sounds. I'm here to tell you it isn't. Non-existence is logically non-suffering. Everything about non-existence is more benevolent than existence for the vast majority of people. Take dating apps for instance. Everything about inceldom is an order of magnitude worse just because they exist.

Say you went on these apps, bluepilled as fuck, and you magically got one match after six months of swiping and testing different photos of yourself. You think to yourself: ""my god, this unicorn SEES something in me, I better not blow it."" The ball is on your court, you have to message her. The message MUST BE PERFECT. It cannot be too long, or too short. It has to be interesting, funny, and it has to have momentum that will escalate the interaction. It has to be sent at the perfect time. Not right away, but not so far apart where you'd seem douchey. You even stress test your message with non-incel friends, and they heap praise at the wit of it. You hit send. You wait three agonizing days.

The one shot you had in six months, when you promised yourself: I better not blow it, well you blew it. YOU FUCKED UP. That 1/10,000 match was just an accident on her part.

The cycle repeats, this time you watched Alpha Male Strategies, you have redpill knowledge now. Failing 6000 times later, you hit the blackpill, and are at the verge of self-destruction. And it's all because you saw a light at the end of the tunnel. But you know what buddy?? That fucking light . . . that's a carrot dangling on a stick. At the end of the day, it's not really you, or Chad, or anyone, yanking that carrot away from you. It's just how the carrot is, it's meant to be yanked, from YOU. You just appeared one day trapped into this silly hamster wheel called existence.

With these dating apps, you cannot quite say it's better to have never tried. Trying in dire straights is inevitable. But you can say, if the opportunity never existed you would have mentally been a saner individual. And this concept extends to life itself. If you just never existed, you would never know the pain of possibilities.

The possibility of anything just equates to misery for the vast majority of people."

This is for men in the United States, no homos, no BJs. Compared to 2002, men overall had the same number of partners in 2013. But the top 20% of men (turbonormies) had a 25% increase in sexual partners, and the top 5% of men (chad) had an outstanding 38% increase in the number of sexual partners. Same amount of sex, but it all shifted to the top.

No surprises to anyone here. But this data is from 5 years ago and I'm sure it radically understates the issue today -- this is mostly pre-Tinder and we've seen how the incel rates spiked since it was released in 2012. This has been in progress for well over a decade, as I'm sure oldcels here can account.

As we all know, the only solution to this social crisis could be some kind of mass awakening. What we don't know is what form it will take. Will people wake up and see how ugly the degeneracy is, steering away from it and rebuilding? Will the inceleration speed up until society slowly collapses into a dull and primitive state, with millions dying in the process? Will they just try to ship us all to gulags in Alaska first? Time will tell."
Debunking false findings and manipulation of data against incels,Blackpill,animucel,"May 15, 2018",6000,17,"https://ifstudies.org/blog/male-sexlessness-is-rising-but-not-for-the-reasons-incels-claim

First let's approach their main conclusion:



The primary cause of the rise in sexlessness is simply the increasing delay of marriage.

Click to expand...

This is not true because it applies only to males. Note the significant increase post 2008 in mainly male celibacy, not female one. If marriages were a problem, why does problem affect males much more significantly, perhaps twice as strong if not more, depending on the source?

Most people have premartial sex (depending on the country ofc). Marriage decline has more to do with culture rather than anything else. Many young people simply decide not to marry, despite making pairs. Or marrying much later. I however fail to see how being in marriage and sex correlate with each other, since seldom anyone but extremely religious people decide not to have it before marriage. I could go on and tell you how women have lower virgin age, have it easier by a sole fact that there's simply more males than females in the reproductive age(pure mathematics), teach you about economics, but this apparently seems irrelevant to this ""amazing study"".




Historically, never-married men have reported higher sexual frequency than never-married women. However, in the 2014 and 2016 GSS samples, that changed: never-married men now report slightly lower sexual frequency than never-married women.

Click to expand...

You call the highest difference in over 25 years ""little""? Relatively, women are having twice as much sex as men do.
Relative change for males compared to females from 2008 to 2016 in sexlessness rising by stunning ~100%, which means there's about twice the amount of men in the group not having sex compared to females. That's roughly ~43% increase for men and ~22.5% increase for women. That's just rough calculations from their chart. So about twice as many men than women, +/- 5%. You call this slightly? Weaselly at best, intentionally misleading at worst.




this is mostly because men are reporting less sex, not that women are reporting more sex. Female sexual frequency is essentially unchanged since 2000. In other words, a key piece of the incel story about rising female promiscuity just isn’t there.

Click to expand...

Let's think about this for a second. If the problem concerned both sexes, the relative change between sexes would be unchanged. Why is the difference between males and females the highest now? If that was true, and people of both genders started having less sex, wouldn't the relative difference of sexlessness between males and females be similar to previous years? Not convincing enough perhaps. Maybe a logical truth-bomb? If women's sex frequency in some group didn't change, but male's did, who's doing all the fucking? A good theory would be that there's a smaller group of males who gets more sex that those males would otherwise get. What other way is there to explain this, considering females are having the same amount of sex, but males get less, and you need both to tango. You said it yourself: Female sexual frequency is essentially unchanged since 2000. And if less males fuck, someone has to keep up with all the fucking. I apologize for language, but I cannot possibly explain this in simpler terms.
So what piece did we miss, ""ifstudies""?




The incel account of events thus far is maybe true in the GSS, but faced strong rebuttals from the NHANES and NSFG data. Not a glowing endorsement of the incel narrative!

Click to expand...

Do you even read the data you show?



:
GSS data contains: People who never married, and ""average"" of people who had zero sexual partners and no sexual encounters.
NSFG data contains: People who never married (JFL)
NHANES data contains: People who never married and who never married and live with a partner (JFLx2)
In 2018, where seldom anyone below 30 marries, what do you expect to see here? That people living with a partner that they are not married to are having sex? Well, data supports that one for sure. Not sure if we needed studies for this one, though.




Many incels quote a rule of thumb that 20% of men have 80% of the sex. Is this true?

Click to expand...

It's a rule of thumb. It will never be perfectly 20% and 80%.



In reality, according to the GSS, the top 20% of the most sexually active never-married young men have about 50-60% of the sex. It’s about the same for women, and these shares are basically stable over time. Measuring the number of partners instead of sexual frequency, the top 20% most promiscuous men account for about 60% of male sexual partnerings, and the trend is, again, quite stable over time.

Click to expand...

Damn, for a rule of thumb, that's pretty damn accurate. Small group of top males are having a go with majority of the females. Damn. And if it's truly stable, that means concerning to my previous findings that the standards are rising pretty damn hard. Since that top 20% of males will be in a lesser group. I think for now, 20/60 rule is fine by me. Still means that 80% of males fight for 40% of females. That's twice as much. Even if we pair everyone 1-to-1, what happens to the 40% of men for who there's no one? Weak argument considering they say ""sex"" and not ""partners"", and I don't know how to define it. Very misleading. Data missing on women as well. No real source given outside of ""GSS"" which has like billion different things.




The core incel story about what’s going on here—that a few Chads are hoarding a growing share of Stacies, depriving incels of mates—just doesn’t hold up. The top 20% of unmarried men are having about the same share of total sexual activity or sexual partnerings as has been the case for decades.

Click to expand...

Your findings are not supported by any data. GSS Does not have 'Top sexual males"" rankings. If you do not publish data, releasing statements might as well be treated as fantasy. I imagine they're, as has been shown, again misinterpreting existing data. I don't even know what GSS data they used to interpret this so I cannot verify it myself. Also it wouldn't make sense if it's true unless it's relative findings, since, as shown before, someone has to keep up with the additional ""sex"" even though less males have it.




The main factor driving this trend, however, isn’t Chads and Stacies, but just declining marriage rates among young men.

Click to expand...

What the fuck? I mean marriage is when a woman and a man get together. Why is that problem only concerning males, then? Hello? You just said that female sexlessness is virtually unchanged, so, who are those women having sex with? Why do they not have a problem with marriage? Who are they marrying, if they are? Something is going on here. But marriages are on the decline in general! Why are you blaming young men for this?



Unmarried people have less sex in general

Click to expand...

Then... if marriage is on the decline.. why is female's celibacy rate not rising? I mean, if young men don't marry, young women would not either. Most marriages are within the same age range, more or less. So I don't get what you're trying to say. It takes two to tango, you know? Both in sex and marriage. Or are they saying no marriage only leaves men sexless?





Thus, while the NSFG shows sexlessness declining, essentially involuntary sources of sexlessness, which I consider to be “other” and “lack of a suitable partner,” are stable or rising.

Click to expand...





But the 68% increase from 2002 to 2015 in the incel share of the male, never-married, 22-35-year-old population is mostly due to a decline in marriage, not never-married men having less sex.

Click to expand...

Why does it only concerns males if that's true? Wouldn't women's relative difference in sexlessness in never married females be the fucking same? But it clearly isn't according to data? Maybe they are saying women are having tremendously more sex outside of marriage compared to men and that it's terribly hard for males to have sex outside of marriage. Well that would make sense. Isn't that what we were saying for quite a while here on incels.is? It simply means some men cannot have sex without the institution of marriage, then. To some degree, at least.




But the big change isn’t a growing share of alpha males hoarding all the sex, nor women suddenly becoming far more choosey amid rising promiscuity; rather, it’s just that marriage is being delayed,

Click to expand...

Again, then why does it not affect women relatively speaking?
You need two to marry. A woman and a man. Well, same-sex marriages exist too I guess. But I don't think that's relevant here.

I will skip the education and housing problem, it's obvious to everyone.



But whatever the direct effect of education on never-married men, the primary cause of the rise in sexlessness is simply the increasing delay of marriage. The delay in marriage has numerous causes, of course, but probably the most powerful driver of marital timing also relates to education. Men and women are much less likely to get married while attending school, and across times and countries, an increase in the years of schooling is associated with later age of marriage, though more-educated people do tend to get married eventually. Thus, as more and more schooling becomes necessary for a good middle-class job, marriage gets pushed later and later, leaving more young people (men and women!) companionless and lonely.

Click to expand...

This whole argument is based on wrong data interpretation. Men are twice more sexless relatively speaking. Look at the data. If it was a marriage problem, we would see such a steep increase not only for men, but for women as well. And yet, relative difference between sexless men and women is the highest in recorded history. Explain this."
(ThugPill) Being Nice is Detrimental to Life Quality of Men (including sex life),Blackpill,Deleted member 5861,"Jun 5, 2018",24000,146,"The desire to expel unselfish members from the group.
Parks, Craig D.,Stone, Asako B.
Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol 99(2), Aug 2010, 303-310
""An initial study investigating tolerance of group members who abuse a public good surprisingly showed that unselfish members (those who gave much toward the provision of the good but then used little of the good) were also targets for expulsion from the group...A fourth study suggested that the target is seen by some as establishing an undesirable behavior standard and by others as a rule breaker. Individuals who formed either perception expressed a desire for the unselfish person to be removed from the group.""

To put it in simpler terms, being altruistic and friendly is just as likely to cause people to reject you as those who are completely selfish and purely look out for their needs only. The study found no significant difference. This contradicts the mainstream advice that having a ""good personality"" will cause people, including women, to like you. They will hate you just as much as someone who practically steals from them. This is also reflected in the workplace, as ""agreeable"" men (peaceful and friendly) are paid significantly less than their disagreeable counterparts. 


""Overall, across the first three studies, men who are one standard deviation below the mean on agreeableness earn an average of 18.31% ($9,772) more than men one standard deviation above the mean on agreeableness. Meanwhile, the “disagreeableness premium” for women was only 5.47% ($1,828). Thus, the income premium for disagreeableness is more than three times stronger for men than for women.""

So as we could see, the price of being nice when you are a man is a staggering 18% of your income throughout life. It is also far stronger in males than females. So this means that nice men in the first study would have been rejected even more often than the nice women. This suggests that nice men are rejected more often than men who are completely selfish and practically steal off of everyone. Now, let us focus more on the effects of being ""mean"" or ""evil"" on attracting a woman. ""A Billion Wicked Thoughts: What the World's Largest Experiment Reveals about Human Desire"" is a book by two neuroscientists that combines countless research by Alfred Kinsey and experiments found on the internet that has a data on over half a billion people to see what are the raw sexual desires of humanity. The book quotes quite a few unnerving conclusions of the sexuality of women based on many individual experiments:


“It turns out that killing people is an effective way to elicit the attention of many women: virtually every serial killer, including Ted Bundy, Charles Manson, and David Berkowitz, have received love letters from large numbers of female fans” (p. 98).
“[Their] inner cavewoman knows Doormat Man would become Sabertooth Tiger Lunch in short order” (p .97).

Psychology Today had an article that confirmed and analyzed how women desire men who are violent, mean, and show criminal behavior, with much thanks to the book mentioned above. 


""women demonstrate a strong erotic preference for dominant men. Or toward what’s now commonly referred to as alpha males—in the authors’ words, men who are 'strong, confident, [and] swaggering [as in 'cocky,' and the pun is intended].' Unfortunately, what these descriptors often imply is behavior sufficiently bearish, self-centered, and insensitive as to often cross the line into a physical, mental, and emotional abuse that can be downright brutal.""
""there’s something in their native wiring that makes a great many of them susceptible to 'bad boys.'""
""many women (at least secretly, or subliminally) can’t help but be drawn toward cold-blooded, controlling, 'bad boys' whose dominance symbolizes quite the opposite of what in relationships they’re consciously seeking.""
""many women experience as enticing the idea of surrendering to a powerful male figure because of its very riskiness. Curiously, such an acutely felt threat can actually be eroticized by women’s minds into exceptional sexual excitement so compelling that (at least on a fantasy level) it’s almost irresistible.""

Femoids can have sex with anyone, but orgasm is only possible with Chad/Tyrone.

Abstract
It has been hypothesized that female orgasm evolved to facilitate recruitment of high-quality genes for offspring. Supporting evidence indicates that female orgasm promotes conception, although this may be mediated by the timing of female orgasm in relation to male ejaculation. This hypothesis also predicts that women will achieve orgasm more frequently when copulating with high-quality males, but limited data exist to support this prediction. We therefore explored relationships between the timing and frequency of women's orgasms and putative markers of the genetic quality of their mates, including measures of attractiveness, facial symmetry, dominance, and masculinity. We found that women reported more frequent and earlier-timed orgasms when mated to masculine and dominant men—those with high scores on a principal component characterized by high objectively-measured facial masculinity, observer-rated facial masculinity, partner-rated masculinity, and partner-rated dominance. Women reported more frequent orgasm during or after male ejaculation when mated to attractive men—those with high scores on a principal component characterized by high observer-rated and self-rated attractiveness. Putative measures of men's genetic quality did not predict their mates' orgasms from self-masturbation or from non-coital partnered sexual behavior. Overall, these results appear to support a role for female orgasm in sire choice.OVera

The results indicate that females exhibit (1) a preference for a male face on the masculine side of average, (2) a shift toward a more masculine male face preference during the high-risk phase of their menstrual cycle, and (3) no shift in other facial preferences. An examination of individual differences revealed that women who scored low on a “masculinity” test (1) showed a larger menstrual shift, (2) had lower self-esteem, and (3) differed in their choice of male faces for dominance and short-term mates.

The share of people of each status who report not having had sex in the past year shows interesting trends that seem to support the basic incel account of changes in mating markets. Recent years have seen increasing sexlessness for never-married men. Celibacy is approximately stable among women. Notably, male sexlessness is also rising among married men.

On the one hand, the incel story of rising male celibacy seems confirmed here; more and more never-married young men are experiencing long sexual droughts.

There are 2 studies I'd like to share

""Is There an Own-Race Preference in Attractiveness?
Evolutionary Psychology · October 2013

We tested whether there is an own-race preference in attractiveness judgments, and also examined the effect of familiarity by comparing the attractiveness ratings given by participants of different ancestral and geographic origins to faces of European, East Asian and African origin.

The current study is designed to produce as fair a test as practicable of whether people perceive own-race faces to be more attractive (on average) than other-race faces, and to examine the possible role of experience in this. In order to achieve this, familiarity with different races was varied both between groups and within groups. Familiarity with different races was varied between groups by using two Australian born-and-raised participant groups (Australian East-Asians and Australian Europeans) and a Hong Kong born-and-raised participant group (Hong Kong East-Asians).









Despite our attempts to obtain genuine, subjective evaluations of “good looks”, by having heterosexual participants only rate opposite-sex faces, and using a cover story that emphasized memorizing the faces to minimize the effects of social desirability, we did not actually find a strong own-race preference. For female participants there was a universal European face preference, and the Australian East Asian participants did not even rate own-race faces as second most attractive, instead rating African faces as equally attractive (for individual faces) or slightly more attractive (for compound faces) than East Asian faces.""

The other study that shows how beauty standards are ingrained in our genes is:

""Preference for attractive faces in human infants extends beyond conspecifics""


""To our knowledge, all previous demonstrations of thepreference that infants display for attractive over un-attractive faces have involved conspeciﬁc (i.e. human)faces. This aspect of the infant face perception literaturehas left open the question of whether the attractivenesspreference is a consequence of an adaptation to matechoice or reﬂects the operation of general perceptual-cognitive mechanisms.

In the present series of experiments, we attempted to address this issue by examining how infants respond to nonhuman animal faces.





The results of Experiment 1 demonstrated that the preference for attractive faces by infants that has previ-ously been observed for human faces can also be observed for domestic cat faces. Experiment 3 demonstrated that infants preferred upright, but not inverted, attractiveover unattractive tiger faces, and Experiment 4 showedthat the spontaneous preference for upright tiger faces impacts infant looking performance on a recognitionmemory task involving an attractive versus unattractive tiger face pairing.""
